- **Enterprise-grade security and compliance**

## **📋 Enhanced Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup (Days 1-2)**

#### **Day 1: Aggressive Cleanup**
```bash
# Morning (2 hours)
- Run documentation cleanup script (60 files removed)
- Archive all legacy MCP integration files
- Remove broken Pulumi TypeScript remnants

# Afternoon (4 hours)
- Standardize Python infrastructure entrypoints
- Consolidate ESC environments (production + development only)
- Update all import paths and references
```

#### **Day 2: Foundation Setup**
```python
# Core Infrastructure Agent Setup
from infrastructure.agents.enhanced_sophia_agent import EnhancedSophiaIntelligenceAgent

# Initialize with business context
agent = EnhancedSophiaIntelligenceAgent(
    business_focus={
        "competitive_intelligence": ["EliseAI", "Hunter Warfield", "RealPage"],
        "target_market": "NMHC Top 50",
        "revenue_impact": "real-time tracking"
    }
)
```

### **Phase 2: AI-Driven Agents (Days 3-5)**

#### **Agent Implementation Priority**
1. **Competitive Intelligence Agent** (Day 3)
   ```python
   # Monitor competitor moves in real-time
   competitive_agent.monitor([
       "eliseai.com/updates",
       "hunterwarfield.com/news",
       "realpage.com/releases"
   ])
   ```

2. **NMHC Enrichment Agent** (Day 4)
   ```python
   # Enrich Top 50 prospects automatically
   enrichment_agent.process_targets(
       source="NMHC Top 50 List",
       enrichment_apis=["Apollo", "CoStar", "LinkedIn"]
   )
   ```

3. **Compliance & Cost Agent** (Day 5)
   ```python
   # Continuous compliance and cost optimization
   compliance_agent.enable_monitoring({
       "regulations": ["PCI DSS", "GLBA", "FDCPA"],
       "cost_targets": {"monthly_limit": 5000, "alert_threshold": 0.8}

    async def create_checkpoint(self, name: str):
        """Create rollback checkpoint before changes"""
        snapshot = await self.snapshots.create(name)
        backup = await self.backups.store_state()
        return CheckPoint(snapshot, backup)
        
    async def rollback_if_needed(self, checkpoint: CheckPoint):
        """Auto-rollback on failure detection"""
        if self.detect_failure():
            await self.snapshots.restore(checkpoint.snapshot)
            await self.backups.restore(checkpoint.backup)
            self.notify_team("Automatic rollback completed")
```

### **Parallel Testing Framework**
```python
# Test new infrastructure alongside legacy
parallel_tester = ParallelInfrastructureTester(
    legacy_stack="sophia-production",
    new_stack="sophia-ai-modernized",
    test_duration="1 business cycle",
    metrics_comparison=["performance", "cost", "reliability"]
