## **🔄 Common Development Workflows**

### **1. Feature Development Workflow**
```bash
# Step 1: Generate initial code
@sophia create a notification service that sends emails and SMS

# Step 2: Analyze quality
@codacy analyze the notification service

# Step 3: Store the decision
@memory remember we chose SendGrid for email delivery

# Step 4: Create tests
@sophia generate comprehensive tests for NotificationService

# Step 5: Create PR
@github create pull request for notification feature
```

### **2. Bug Fixing Workflow**
```bash
# Step 1: Check if we've seen this before
@memory search for "connection timeout" errors

# Step 2: Get debugging help
@sophia debug: PostgreSQL connection keeps timing out

# Step 3: Implement fix
@sophia show me how to implement connection pooling

# Step 4: Verify fix
@codacy verify the connection pooling implementation
```

### **3. Code Review Workflow**
```bash
# Step 1: Get overview
@sophia summarize the changes in this PR

# Step 2: Security check
@codacy security scan for the new endpoints

# Step 3: Architecture review
@sophia does this follow our established patterns?

# Step 4: Suggest improvements
@sophia suggest improvements for this code
```

## **🧩 Integration Patterns**

### **Sophia + Codacy Integration**
```python
# Sophia generates code, Codacy validates it
# Example: Generate secure API endpoint

# 1. Generate with Sophia
"""
@sophia create a secure API endpoint for user profile updates 
with input validation and rate limiting
"""

# 2. Auto-analyze with Codacy
"""
@codacy analyze security of the new endpoint
"""

# 3. Apply fixes if needed
"""
@sophia apply Codacy's security recommendations
"""
```

### **Sophia + AI Memory Integration**
```python
# Remember architectural decisions and patterns

# 1. Make a decision
"""
@sophia should we use Redis or Memcached for caching?
"""

# 2. Store the decision
"""
@memory remember: We chose Redis for caching because it supports 
data persistence and has better data structure support
"""

# 3. Recall later
"""
@memory what caching solution did we choose and why?
"""
```

## **⚙️ Configuration Tips**

### **Cursor IDE Settings**
```json
// .cursor/settings.json
{
  "sophia.autoComplete": true,
  "sophia.contextAwareness": "high",
  "codacy.autoAnalyze": true,
  "codacy.fixOnSave": false,
  "aiMemory.autoStore": true
}
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```yaml
# For faster responses, use these model preferences:
fast_tasks:
  - code_completion: "claude-3-haiku"
  - simple_queries: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  
quality_tasks:
  - architecture_design: "claude-3-sonnet"
  - complex_debugging: "gpt-4"
```

## **🚨 Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**Sophia not responding?**
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8092/health

# Restart if needed
docker-compose restart sophia-intelligence
```

**Codacy not analyzing?**
```bash
# Check Codacy token
echo $CODACY_API_TOKEN

# Test connection
curl http://localhost:3008/health
```

**Memory not storing?**
```bash
# Check AI Memory status
curl http://localhost:9000/health

# View recent memories
curl http://localhost:9000/memories/recent
```

## **🎉 You're Ready!**

You now have everything you need to start AI-assisted development with Sophia. Remember:

1. **Natural language is key** - Just describe what you want
2. **Context matters** - Sophia understands your project
3. **Iterate quickly** - Generate, analyze, improve
4. **Learn patterns** - Sophia remembers what works

**Need more help?** Type `@sophia help` for context-aware assistance.
