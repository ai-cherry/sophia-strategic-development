```

## **üß† AI Memory Commands**

### **Storing Information**
```bash
# Architecture decisions
@memory remember: We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because we need ACID compliance

# Technical choices
@memory store: Using Redis for session management with 15-minute TTL

# Bug solutions
@memory save: Fixed timeout issue by implementing connection pooling

# Code patterns
@memory record: Always use dependency injection for service classes
```

### **Retrieving Information**
```bash
# Search by topic
@memory what database did we choose?

# Search by problem
@memory how did we fix the authentication timeout?

# Search by pattern
@memory what's our standard error handling pattern?

# Recent decisions
@memory show recent architecture decisions
```

## **üêô GitHub Commands**

### **Repository Operations**
```bash
# Create pull request
@github create PR titled "Add user authentication feature"

# Create issue
@github open issue: "Performance degradation in search API"

# Branch operations
@github create feature branch for payment integration

# Code review
@github request review from senior developers
```

### **Workflow Management**
```bash
@github run CI/CD pipeline

@github check workflow status

@github deploy to staging environment

@github tag release v2.1.0
```

## **üê≥ Docker Commands**

### **Container Management**
```bash
# Build and run
@docker build and run the application

# Development environment
@docker start development environment with hot reload

# Production deployment
@docker build optimized production image

# Debugging
@docker show logs for the api container
```

### **Compose Operations**
```bash
@docker compose up all services

@docker restart the database container

@docker scale api service to 3 instances

@docker update service with new image
```

## **üîÑ Workflow Combinations**

### **Feature Development Flow**
```bash
# 1. Start with idea
@sophia help me design a notification system

# 2. Generate implementation

# 3. Quality check
@codacy analyze the notification service code

# 4. Store decisions
@memory remember: Using Twilio for SMS and SendGrid for email

# 5. Create tests
@sophia generate tests for NotificationService

# 6. Version control
@github create feature/notifications branch and PR
```

### **Bug Fix Flow**
```bash
# 1. Understand the issue
@sophia explain this error: ConnectionRefusedError

# 2. Check history
@memory have we seen connection errors before?

# 3. Get solution
@sophia how to implement retry logic with exponential backoff

# 4. Verify fix
@codacy check if the retry logic is implemented correctly

# 5. Document
@memory save: Added retry logic to handle transient connection failures
```

```

## **üí° Pro Tips**

### **Be Specific**
```bash
# ‚ùå Vague
@sophia create a function

# ‚úÖ Specific
@sophia create an async Python function that fetches user data from PostgreSQL, 
caches it in Redis for 5 minutes, and includes error handling
```

### **Provide Context**
```bash
# ‚ùå No context
@sophia fix this error

# ‚úÖ With context
@sophia fix this error in our FastAPI application: 
"RuntimeError: Event loop is closed" when running async tests
```

### **Chain Commands**
```bash
# Generate ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Improve
@sophia create user authentication endpoint &&
@codacy analyze security &&
@sophia apply security best practices
```

### **Use Memory Effectively**
```bash
# Before making decisions
@memory what authentication method did we use in other services?

# After implementing
@memory remember: Implemented OAuth2 with JWT for user service
```

## **üé® Advanced Patterns**

### **Conditional Commands**
```bash
@sophia if this is a public API, add rate limiting

@codacy only fix critical security issues

@memory search for similar issues in the last month
```

### **Batch Operations**
```bash
@sophia generate CRUD endpoints for all models in models.py

@codacy analyze all files changed in the last commit

@docker restart all services except database
```

### **Interactive Flows**
```bash
@sophia walk me through implementing a payment system step by step

@sophia explain each line of this complex algorithm

@codacy show me issues one by one with explanations
```
