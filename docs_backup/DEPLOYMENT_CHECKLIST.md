This checklist outlines the steps required to deploy the SOPHIA AI System to production environments.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Preparation

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify target environment (development, staging, production)
- [ ] Ensure all required environment variables are defined
- [ ] Verify access to all required external services
- [ ] Check infrastructure provisioning status

### Code Preparation
- [ ] Merge all feature branches to main
- [ ] Run all tests and verify passing status
- [ ] Check code coverage (minimum 80%)
- [ ] Run linters and formatters
- [ ] Verify documentation is up-to-date

### Database Preparation
- [ ] Prepare database migration scripts
- [ ] Backup existing database (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify migration rollback procedures
- [ ] Prepare initial data seeding scripts

### Security Preparation
- [ ] Complete security checklist (see SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
- [ ] Rotate all API keys and secrets
- [ ] Update Pulumi ESC with new secrets
- [ ] Confirm containers load secrets from Pulumi ESC at runtime
- [ ] Verify JWT configuration
- [ ] Check CORS settings

### Integration Preparation
- [ ] Verify all integration endpoints are accessible

- [ ] Prepare fallback mechanisms for external services
- [ ] Update webhook configurations (if needed)

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Infrastructure Deployment
- [ ] Run Pulumi deployment
  ```bash
  cd infrastructure
  pulumi up
  ```python
- [ ] Verify all resources are created successfully
- [ ] Check resource configurations
- [ ] Verify network connectivity

### Database Deployment
- [ ] Run database migrations
  ```bash
  alembic upgrade head
  ```python
- [ ] Verify migration success
- [ ] Run data seeding scripts (if needed)
- [ ] Verify data integrity

### Application Deployment
- [ ] Build Docker images
  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```python
- [ ] Push images to registry (if applicable)
- [ ] Deploy application containers
  ```bash
  docker-compose --profile production up -d
  ```python
- [ ] Verify all containers are running

  docker-compose up -d mcp-server
  ```python
- [ ] Verify MCP server is running
- [ ] Test MCP tools and resources
- [ ] Check MCP server logs

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] Verify API health endpoint
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8000/health
  ```python
- [ ] Check MCP server health
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8002/health
  ```python
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Check vector database connectivity
- [ ] Verify Redis connectivity

### Functionality Checks
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization

- [ ] Update project management tools
- [ ] Document deployment in knowledge base

### External Communication
- [ ] Notify users (if applicable)
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Prepare release notes
- [ ] Schedule training sessions (if needed)

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment failure, follow these steps to rollback:

1. Stop all containers
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile production down
   ```python

2. Rollback database migrations
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```python

3. Deploy previous version
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-tag>
   docker-compose --profile production up -d
   ```python

4. Verify rollback success
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```python

5. Notify all stakeholders of the rollback
