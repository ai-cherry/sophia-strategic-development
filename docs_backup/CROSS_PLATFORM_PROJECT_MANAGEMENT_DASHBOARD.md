# 📋 **Executive Project Visibility Dashboard**

*Unified executive oversight across team tools: Asana, Linear, Slack, and Notion*

## 🎯 **Core Purpose**

The Executive Project Visibility Dashboard serves **one primary purpose**: to provide leadership with unified visibility across all projects, regardless of which tools teams use. This is **not** an operational project management tool—it's an executive oversight platform that aggregates project status from your team's preferred tools.

### **Key Principle**
Teams continue using their preferred tools (Asana, Linear, Notion, Slack) while executives get a single, high-level view of everything happening across the organization.

- **Linear**: Development issues → Progress and risk indicators  
- **Notion**: Strategic documentation → Planning visibility
- **Slack**: Team communication → Health monitoring

### **🎯 Executive Value Flow**
```
Team Tools → Data Aggregation → Executive KPIs → Strategic Decisions
