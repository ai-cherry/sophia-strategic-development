# üîß Relaxed Pre-Commit Rules Summary

## Overview
We've updated the Sophia AI pre-commit hooks to be more balanced and developer-friendly while still maintaining essential security and quality standards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Wildcard Imports
- **BEFORE**: ‚ùå Blocked all commits with wildcard imports
- **AFTER**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows warning but allows commit
- **RATIONALE**: Wildcard imports aren't dangerous, just less clear

### 2. TODO Comments
- **BEFORE**: ‚ùå Blocked all TODOs without ticket references
- **AFTER**: 
  - ‚úÖ Allow regular TODOs (just shows count)
  - ‚ùå Block only sensitive TODOs (password, secret, key, token, hack, broken, urgent, critical)
- **RATIONALE**: TODOs are normal part of development, only security-related ones are dangerous

### 3. Temporary Code
- **BEFORE**: ‚ùå Blocked all temporary code patterns
- **AFTER**: 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warn about general temporary patterns (placeholder, temp, for now)
  - ‚ùå Block only dangerous patterns (security hacks, critical fixes with secrets)
- **RATIONALE**: Temporary code is sometimes necessary during development

### 4. Code Quality Checks
- **BEFORE**: Warnings about missing docstrings and error handling
- **AFTER**: 
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Informational counts of new functions/API calls
  - ‚ùå Block only hardcoded secrets (password=, secret=, api_key=)
- **RATIONALE**: Quality improvements shouldn't block commits, but security issues should

## What Still Blocks Commits (Security-Critical)

1. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Variables assigned literal secret values
2. **Sensitive TODOs**: Comments mentioning passwords, secrets, keys, tokens
3. **Dangerous Temporary Code**: Security hacks, critical fixes with secrets

## What Now Shows Warnings (Non-Blocking)

1. **Wildcard Imports**: `from module import *`
2. **Regular TODOs**: `# TODO: Fix this later`
3. **Temporary Code**: `placeholder`, `temp`, `for now`
4. **Missing Docstrings**: Count of new functions without docs
5. **API Calls**: Count of new API calls without visible error handling

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Faster Development**: No more blocked commits for minor issues
- ‚úÖ **Security Maintained**: Still blocks dangerous patterns
- ‚úÖ **Quality Awareness**: Developers still see quality suggestions
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Allows normal development patterns
- ‚úÖ **Balanced Approach**: Strict where it matters, relaxed where it doesn't

## Testing

The relaxed pre-commit hooks have been tested and are working correctly. They provide helpful feedback without blocking the development workflow.

## Usage

The hooks run automatically on every commit. No changes needed to your development workflow - just commit as normal and you'll see helpful feedback instead of blocking errors.
