## üí° **Integration Strategy**

### **Intelligent Server Routing**
With multiple repositories cloned, we can implement intelligent routing:

```python
# Route based on capabilities and performance
routing_strategy = {
    'web_automation': {
        'primary': 'microsoft_playwright',
        'fallback': 'custom_playwright'
    },
    'cost_optimization': {
        'primary': 'portkey_admin',
        'secondary': 'portkey_gateway'  
    },
    'database_analytics': {
        'ai_powered': 'snowflake_cortex_official',
        'sql_optimization': 'isaacwasserman_snowflake',
        'secure_access': 'davidamom_snowflake',
        'read_only': 'dynamike_snowflake'
    },
    'model_access': {
        'diverse_models': 'openrouter_search',
        'premium_models': 'portkey_gateway'
    }
}
```

### **Performance Optimization**
