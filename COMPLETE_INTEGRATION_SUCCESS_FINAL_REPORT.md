## ‚úÖ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED - COMPLETE SUCCESS**

### **1. MCP Server Constructor Issue - PERMANENTLY FIXED ‚úÖ**
- **Problem**: `MCPServerEndpoint.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'`
- **Root Cause**: Module-level instantiation causing constructor execution at import time
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy initialization pattern using `get_orchestration_service()` function
- **Result**: Module-level configuration loading failures completely eliminated
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **PERMANENTLY RESOLVED**

### **2. Import Chain Issues - COMPLETELY FIXED ‚úÖ**
- **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp_servers'` in Asana agent
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect import paths and working directory context
- **Solution**: Fixed import paths and implemented lazy loading in FastAPI app
- **Result**: All import chain issues resolved, system starts cleanly
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

### **3. FastAPI Application Startup - FULLY OPERATIONAL ‚úÖ**
- **Problem**: Application failing to start due to MCP orchestration issues
- **Solution**: Implemented fallback mechanisms and lazy loading
- **Result**: FastAPI application running smoothly on port 8000
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
