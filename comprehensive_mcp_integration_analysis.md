    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setup_authentication()
        self.setup_rate_limiting()
        self.setup_monitoring()
    
    @tool()
    def standard_tool(self, params):
        """Standard tool implementation with error handling"""
        try:
            return self.execute_business_logic(params)
