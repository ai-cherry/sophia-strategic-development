   - No shortcuts on implementation
   - Full test coverage required
   - Documentation in parallel

2. **Incremental Deployment**
   - Test each component thoroughly
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Monitor closely in production

3. **Team Alignment**
   - Daily standups during implementation
   - Clear ownership of components
   - Regular progress reviews

## 📅 Next Immediate Steps

### This Week (July 10-14)
1. **Today**: Review and approve all plans
2. **Tomorrow**: Set up UV locally
3. **Friday**: Begin dependency migration
4. **Weekend**: Prepare Week 2 resources

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
