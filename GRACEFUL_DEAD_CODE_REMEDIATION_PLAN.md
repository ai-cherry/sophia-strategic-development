# Graceful Dead Code Remediation & AI Coding Enhancement Plan
**Building on Sophia AI's Existing World-Class Infrastructure**

## üéØ **Strategic Approach: Enhance, Don't Replace**

Based on comprehensive analysis of your dead code audit and existing infrastructure, this plan **builds on your proven systems** while addressing specific technical debt categories.

### **‚úÖ Existing Infrastructure Strengths**
- AI Junk Prevention Service (operational)
- AI Code Quality MCP Server (port 9025)
- Codacy MCP Server (port 3008)
- Pre-commit hooks (Black, Ruff, Bandit)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- AI Memory System for decisions
- Automated cleanup scripts

### **üéØ Dead Code Categories to Address**
1. Monorepo transition artifacts (`apps/`, `libs/`)
2. Deprecated/removed systems remnants
3. Legacy/consolidated application files
4. Deprecated Dockerfiles
5. One-time scripts and temporary files

## üìã **Phase 1: Enhanced Dead Code Detection & Prevention**

### **1.1 Enhanced AI Junk Prevention Service**
*Building on existing `backend/services/ai_junk_prevention_service.py`*

**Implementation**: Extend existing forbidden patterns to include audit findings:

```python
# Enhanced patterns for dead code categories identified in audit
ENHANCED_FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS = {
    # Monorepo transition artifacts (Category 2.1)
    r"^apps/(?!README\.md$).*": "Use backend/ structure during transition",
    r"^libs/(?!README\.md$).*": "Use backend/ structure during transition",

    # One-time scripts and reports (Category 2.5)
    r".*_REPORT\.md$": "One-time reports should be deleted after use",
    r".*_SUMMARY\.md$": "One-time summaries should be deleted after use",
    r".*_PLAN\.md$": "One-time plans should be deleted after implementation",
    r".*_STATUS\.md$": "One-time status files should be deleted after use",
    r".*_COMPLETE\.md$": "Completion reports should be deleted after use",
    r".*_SUCCESS\.md$": "Success reports should be deleted after use",
    r".*_ANALYSIS\.md$": "Analysis reports should be deleted after use",
    r".*_PROMPT\.md$": "Prompt files should be deleted after use",

    # Deprecated Dockerfiles (Category 2.4)
    r"^Dockerfile\.(?!production$).*": "Use Dockerfile.production only",
    r".*\.backup\.[\d_]+$": "Backup files should be cleaned up",

    # Legacy FastAPI apps (Category 2.3)
    r"backend/app/(?!fastapi_main\.py$).*\.py$": "Use unified fastapi_main.py",
}

# Auto-cleanup rules for aged files
AUTO_CLEANUP_RULES = {
    "one_time_scripts": {
        "pattern": r"scripts/(?:fix_|deploy_|cleanup_|migrate_|test_|validate_|one_time_).*\.py$",
        "max_age_days": 30,
        "action": "archive_then_delete"
    },
    "temporary_reports": {
        "pattern": r".*(?:_REPORT|_SUMMARY|_PLAN|_STATUS|_COMPLETE|_SUCCESS|_ANALYSIS)\.md$",
        "max_age_days": 7,
        "action": "archive_then_delete"
    }
}
```

### **1.2 AI Code Quality MCP Server Enhancement**
*Building on existing `backend/mcp_servers/ai_code_quality/`*

**New Natural Language Commands**:
```python
# Dead code detection commands
"Find all dead code in the codebase"
"Identify unused imports across all Python files"
"Detect unreachable code in backend services"
"Find duplicate functionality between services"
"Identify deprecated Dockerfiles for cleanup"
"Scan for monorepo transition artifacts"

# Automated cleanup commands
"Clean up one-time scripts older than 30 days"
"Archive temporary reports and delete originals"
"Consolidate duplicate Docker configurations"
"Remove unused FastAPI application files"
```

### **1.3 GitHub Actions Integration**
*Extending existing `.github/workflows/`*

**Enhanced Dead Code Detection Workflow**:
```yaml
name: Dead Code Detection & Prevention
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1' # Weekly Monday 2AM

jobs:
  dead-code-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Enhanced Dead Code Scan
        run: |
          # Use existing AI Code Quality server
          python scripts/enhanced_dead_code_scanner.py

      - name: Auto-cleanup Aged Files
        run: |
          # Use existing junk prevention service
          python backend/services/ai_junk_prevention_service.py --auto-cleanup

      - name: Generate Cleanup Report
        run: |
          # Create PR with cleanup recommendations
          python scripts/create_cleanup_pr.py
```

---

## üìã **Phase 2: Targeted Dead Code Remediation**

### **2.1 Monorepo Transition Artifact Management**

**Safe Approach**: Mark future-use directories clearly without deletion:

```bash
# Create clear future-use markers
echo "# Monorepo Future Structure - DO NOT USE YET
This directory is reserved for monorepo transition (target: February 2025).
Continue using backend/ and frontend/ for all current development.
See docs/monorepo/MONOREPO_TRANSITION_GUIDE.md for timeline." > apps/.FUTURE_USE_ONLY

echo "# Shared Libraries - DO NOT USE YET
This directory is reserved for monorepo shared libraries.
Current shared code should remain in backend/core/ and backend/utils/.
See docs/monorepo/MONOREPO_TRANSITION_GUIDE.md for migration plan." > libs/.FUTURE_USE_ONLY
```

### **2.2 Dockerfile Consolidation**

**Identify Production Dockerfile**:
```python
# Enhanced dockerfile analyzer using existing infrastructure
def analyze_dockerfile_usage():
    """Determine the authoritative production Dockerfile"""
    dockerfiles = {
        "Dockerfile": analyze_usage("Dockerfile"),
        "Dockerfile.production": analyze_usage("Dockerfile.production"),
        "Dockerfile.uv.production": analyze_usage("Dockerfile.uv.production"),
        # ... analyze all variants
    }

    # Use existing AI Memory to recall which is production
    production_dockerfile = ai_memory.recall("production dockerfile decision")

    return {
        "production": production_dockerfile,
        "archive": [f for f in dockerfiles if f != production_dockerfile]
    }
```

### **2.3 FastAPI Application Unification**

**Verification Script**:
```python
# Build on existing service analysis tools
def verify_fastapi_unification():
    """Verify single FastAPI entry point using existing patterns"""

    # Check if fastapi_main.py is the sole entry point
    main_app = Path("backend/fastapi_main.py")

    if main_app.exists():
        # Use existing AI Code Quality server to analyze
        unused_apps = find_unused_fastapi_apps()
        return {
            "status": "unified",
            "main_entry": "backend/fastapi_main.py",
            "safe_to_remove": unused_apps
        }
    else:
        return {"status": "needs_unification"}
```

---

## üìã **Phase 3: Automated Prevention & Monitoring**

### **3.1 Real-time Dead Code Prevention**

**Pre-commit Hook Enhancement**:
```yaml
# Add to existing .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: dead-code-prevention
        name: Prevent dead code patterns
        entry: python backend/services/ai_junk_prevention_service.py
        language: python
        pass_filenames: true

      - id: one-time-script-reminder
        name: Remind about one-time script deletion
        entry: python scripts/one_time_script_reminder.py
        language: python
        files: '^scripts/(fix_|deploy_|cleanup_|migrate_|test_|validate_|one_time_).*\.py$'
```

### **3.2 AI Memory Integration for Dead Code Prevention**

**Architectural Decision Storage**:
```python
# Integration with existing AI Memory MCP Server
decisions_to_store = [
    "We use Dockerfile.production as the single production image",
    "One-time scripts must be deleted within 30 days of creation",
    "All new code goes in backend/ during monorepo transition",
    "FastAPI entry point is backend/fastapi_main.py only"
]

for decision in decisions_to_store:
    ai_memory.store_decision(decision, category="dead_code_prevention")
```
