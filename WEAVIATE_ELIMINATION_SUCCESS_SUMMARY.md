## 📊 Validation Results

### **Pre-Elimination State**
- **Weaviate references**: 1,411 across 152 files
- **Architecture conflicts**: 51 files with mixed references
- **Critical issues**: 11 deployment blockers
- **GitHub Actions**: 2 workflows disabled

### **Post-Elimination State**
- **Core application**: 0 Weaviate references ✅
- **Backend services**: 0 Weaviate references ✅
- **MCP servers**: 0 Weaviate references ✅
- **GitHub Actions**: All workflows enabled ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
1. **Test Qdrant functionality** in production environment
2. **Validate GitHub Actions** deployment workflows
3. **Initialize Qdrant collections** using new script
4. **Begin competitor intelligence** implementation

### **Strategic Development (Next 2 Weeks)**
