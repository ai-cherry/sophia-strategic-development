## 🚀 Code Examples

### CEO Roast Mode Response
```python
🔥 Roast Mode Activated 🔥

Oh, asking about revenue AGAIN? Let me check my crystal ball... 
oh wait, it's just your spreadsheet crying.

But since you asked so nicely:
• Q3 2025 revenue increased by 23% YoY to $4.2M
• Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) hit $350K in June

📱 Trending on X:
• Tech revenue growth hitting record highs in 2025 #earnings
```

### Multi-Hop Query with Personalization
```python
# Enhanced query with BI detection and expansion
result = await orchestrator.multi_hop_query(
    "Revenue trends?",
    user_id="ceo_user",
    context={"focus": "revenue"}
)
# Automatically expands to include MRR, growth, forecasts
# Reranks based on user's revenue focus preference
```

### n8n Alpha Optimization
```python
# Automatic alpha tuning based on Prometheus metrics
optimal_alpha = await optimizer.optimize_alpha(
    service="hubspot_api",
    window_minutes=5
)
# If P95 latency > 150ms, alpha → 0.55
# If P95 latency < 150ms, alpha → 0.45
```

## ✅ Deliverables
