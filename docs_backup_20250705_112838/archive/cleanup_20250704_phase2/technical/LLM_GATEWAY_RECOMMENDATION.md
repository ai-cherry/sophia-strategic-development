# LLM Gateway Strategy Recommendation

## Executive Recommendation

Based on the analysis of Sophia AI's current LLM usage patterns, I recommend implementing a **hybrid gateway strategy** that leverages both Portkey and OpenRouter in complementary roles:

1. **Portkey** as the primary enterprise gateway for production workloads
2. **OpenRouter** as a secondary gateway for experimentation and cost-optimized models
3. **Unified LLM Service** abstraction layer for all internal services
4. **CEO Dashboard Integration** for centralized control and monitoring

## Why This Hybrid Approach?

### Portkey Strengths
- **Enterprise Features**: Semantic caching, observability, compliance
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with your existing OpenAI/Anthropic keys
- **Advanced Routing**: Conditional routing based on metadata
- **Cost Optimization**: Up to 50% savings through semantic caching
- **Production Ready**: Used by enterprises, reliable infrastructure

### OpenRouter Strengths
- **Model Variety**: Access to 200+ models including niche/experimental ones
- **Cost Transparency**: Clear per-token pricing
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Simple API, easy to integrate
- **Community Models**: Access to open-source models
- **Rapid Innovation**: Quickly adds new models

### Complementary Benefits
- Use Portkey for critical business operations (reliability + caching)
- Use OpenRouter for experimentation and cost-sensitive bulk operations
- Maintain flexibility to switch between gateways based on needs
- Avoid vendor lock-in with abstraction layer

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Unified LLM Service Layer

```python
# backend/services/unified_llm_service.py
class UnifiedLLMService:
    """
    Single point of access for all LLM operations in Sophia AI
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Primary gateway - Portkey for production
        self.portkey = PortkeyClient(
            api_key=get_config_value("portkey_api_key"),
            virtual_keys={
                "openai": get_config_value("portkey_virtual_key_openai"),
                "anthropic": get_config_value("portkey_virtual_key_anthropic"),
            }
        )

        # Secondary gateway - OpenRouter for experimentation
        self.openrouter = OpenRouterClient(
            api_key=get_config_value("openrouter_api_key")
        )

        # Snowflake for analytics
        self.analytics = SnowflakeLLMAnalytics()

        # Model registry
        self.models = self._load_model_registry()

    async def complete(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        task_type: TaskType,
        model_preference: str = None,
        use_cache: bool = True,
        gateway_override: str = None
    ) -> LLMResponse:
        """
        Unified interface for all LLM completions
        """
        # Select gateway based on task and configuration
        gateway = self._select_gateway(task_type, gateway_override)

        # Select model based on task requirements
        model = self._select_model(task_type, model_preference)

        # Execute request with monitoring
        response = await self._execute_request(
            gateway, model, prompt, use_cache
        )

        # Track analytics
        await self._track_usage(response)

        return response
```

### 2. Model Registry Configuration

```yaml
# config/llm_models.yaml
gateways:
  portkey:
    priority: 1
    use_for: [production, critical, real_time]
    features: [semantic_cache, observability, fallback]

  openrouter:
    priority: 2
    use_for: [experimentation, bulk, cost_sensitive]
    features: [model_variety, transparent_pricing]

models:
  # Tier 1 - Premium Models (via Portkey)
  gpt-4o:
    gateway: portkey
    provider: openai
    cost_per_1k_input: 0.01
    cost_per_1k_output: 0.03
    capabilities: [reasoning, code, vision]
    use_for: [executive_insights, complex_analysis]

### 3. CEO Dashboard Integration

```typescript
// frontend/src/components/dashboard/LLMControlPanel.tsx
interface LLMControlPanel {
  // Real-time metrics
  currentCost: number;
  dailyBudget: number;
  modelUsage: ModelUsageStats[];

  // Configuration controls
  preferredModels: ModelPreference[];
  routingRules: RoutingRule[];
  cacheSettings: CacheConfig;

  // Actions
  onModelPreferenceChange: (model: string, preference: number) => void;
  onBudgetUpdate: (budget: number) => void;
  onRoutingRuleAdd: (rule: RoutingRule) => void;
}
```

## Conclusion

The hybrid Portkey + OpenRouter strategy provides the best of both worlds:
- Enterprise-grade features for production (Portkey)
- Flexibility and variety for experimentation (OpenRouter)
- Unified interface for developers
- CEO dashboard for control
- Significant cost savings through optimization

This approach aligns with Sophia AI's priorities of quality, stability, and maintainability while providing the flexibility needed for rapid innovation.
