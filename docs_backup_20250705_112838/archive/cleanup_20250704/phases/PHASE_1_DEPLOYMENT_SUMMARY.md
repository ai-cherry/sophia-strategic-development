## Architecture Enhancements

### Monitoring Stack
```
MCP Servers → Health Monitor → Production Monitor → Prometheus → Grafana
                     ↓                ↓
                Cache Service    Circuit Breakers
```

### Intelligent Routing
```
Request → Capability Router → Health Check → Primary Server
                                    ↓
                              Fallback Servers
```

### Caching Layer
```
CEO Query → GPTCache → Sentence Transformers → Semantic Match → Fast Response
                              ↓
                        Pre-warmed Queries
