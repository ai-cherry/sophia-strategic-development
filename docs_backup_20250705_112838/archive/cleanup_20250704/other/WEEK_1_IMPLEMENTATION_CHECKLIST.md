  ```bash
  # Docker deployment on Lambda Labs
  docker run -d --name pyroscope \
    -p 4040:4040 \
    pyroscope/pyroscope:latest \
    server
  ```
- [ ] Install profiling libraries
  ```python
  # backend/requirements.txt additions
  py-spy==0.3.14
  pyroscope-io==0.8.5
  memory-profiler==0.61.0
  ```
- [ ] Create baseline profiling script
  ```python
  # scripts/performance/baseline_profiler.py
  - API endpoint response times
  - Database query performance
  - Memory usage patterns
  - CPU utilization
  ```

### Afternoon (4 hours)
- [ ] Set up K6 load testing infrastructure
  ```javascript
  // tests/load/baseline.js
  import http from 'k6/http';
  import { check } from 'k6';

  export let options = {
    stages: [
      { duration: '2m', target: 100 },
      { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
      { duration: '2m', target: 0 },
    ],
    thresholds: {
      http_req_duration: ['p(95)<200'],
    },
  };
  ```
- [ ] Create performance dashboard in Grafana
- [ ] Document current bottlenecks

## Tuesday: Architecture Decision Records

### Morning (4 hours)
- [ ] Create ADR template
  ```markdown
  # ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture

  ## Context
  [Why we need this]

  ## Decision
  [What we're doing]

  ## Consequences
  [What happens as a result]
  ```

## Wednesday: Database Optimization Planning

### Morning (4 hours)
- [ ] Analyze current Snowflake usage
  ```sql
  -- Query performance analysis
  SELECT query_id,
         execution_time,
         bytes_scanned,
         rows_produced
  FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history
  WHERE execution_time > 1000
  ORDER BY execution_time DESC
  LIMIT 100;
  ```

- [ ] Identify clustering opportunities
- [ ] Plan materialized views
- [ ] Design partitioning strategy

### Afternoon (4 hours)
- [ ] Create Snowflake optimization scripts
  ```sql
  -- Clustering key recommendations
  ALTER TABLE sophia_core.unified_data_catalog
  CLUSTER BY (created_at, source_system);

  -- Result cache configuration
  ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;
  ```

- [ ] Design connection pooling architecture
- [ ] Plan async query patterns

## Thursday: Caching Architecture Design

### Morning (4 hours)
- [ ] Design 4-tier caching strategy
  ```yaml
  tiers:
    L1_process:
      technology: "In-memory LRU"
      size: "1GB per instance"
      ttl: "60 seconds"

    L2_shared:
      technology: "Redis Cluster"
      size: "100GB"
      ttl: "5 minutes"

    L3_database:
      technology: "Snowflake Result Cache"
      size: "Unlimited"
      ttl: "24 hours"

    L4_edge:
      technology: "Cloudflare Workers KV"
      size: "Unlimited"
      ttl: "Variable"
  ```

- [ ] Create cache key strategy
- [ ] Design cache invalidation patterns

### Afternoon (4 hours)
- [ ] Implement Redis cluster configuration
- [ ] Create cache warming strategy
- [ ] Design cache monitoring

## Friday: Team Onboarding & Documentation

  ```markdown
  # Performance-First Development Guide

  1. Every PR must include performance impact
  2. Use profiling in development
  3. Follow caching guidelines
  4. Implement circuit breakers
  ```

- [ ] Set up team training sessions
