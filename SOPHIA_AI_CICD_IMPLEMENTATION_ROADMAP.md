# 🚀 Sophia AI CI/CD Implementation Roadmap

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive CI/CD automation framework for Sophia AI, but several key steps are needed to make it fully operational. This roadmap provides the exact actions required to activate enterprise-grade deployment automation.

## 🎯 **WHAT WE'VE BUILT**

### ✅ **Completed Infrastructure**

1. **Enhanced Deployment Health Gate** (`scripts/ci/deployment_health_gate.py`)
   - Pulumi ESC integration for secret management
   - Comprehensive service validation (Snowflake, OpenAI, Anthropic, Pinecone)
   - MCP server health monitoring
   - Detailed reporting with JSON artifacts

2. **MCP Server Orchestrator** (`scripts/start_all_mcp_servers.py`)
   - Priority-based startup with dependency management
   - Health monitoring and automatic recovery
   - Comprehensive status reporting
   - Production-ready error handling

3. **Production Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy_sophia_production.py`)
   - 7-phase deployment pipeline (Prerequisites → Infrastructure → Backend → Frontend → MCP → Health → Tests)
   - Automated rollback capabilities
   - Comprehensive logging and audit trails
   - Environment-aware deployment

4. **Master GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/sophia-master-deployment.yml`)
   - 9-job orchestration pipeline
   - Environment detection and validation
   - Quality gates and security scanning
   - Automated PR comments and deployment reports

5. **Enhanced Health Gate Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deployment_health_gate.yml`)
   - UV-based dependency management
   - Pulumi ESC environment setup
   - Artifact collection and PR reporting

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup (Priority 1 - 1 Day)**

#### 1.1 **Pulumi ESC Secret Validation**
```bash
# Verify all required secrets are in Pulumi ESC
pulumi env get scoobyjava-org/default/sophia-ai-production
```

**Required Secrets:**
- `openai_api_key`
- `anthropic_api_key`
- `pinecone_api_key`
- `gong_access_token`
- `snowflake_password`
- `snowflake_account`
- `vercel_token` (for frontend deployment)

#### 1.2 **GitHub Secrets Configuration**
Navigate to [GitHub Organization Secrets](https://github.com/organizations/ai-cherry/settings/secrets/actions) and ensure:
- `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` is set (if using Vercel)
- All other secrets are syncing from GitHub → Pulumi ESC

#### 1.3 **Environment Variables**
Set persistent environment variables:
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=prod
export PULUMI_ORG=scoobyjava-org
export PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### **Phase 2: MCP Server Preparation (Priority 2 - 2 Days)**

#### 2.1 **MCP Server Standardization**
```bash
# Run the standardization script to ensure all servers have health endpoints
python scripts/standardise_mcp.py
```

#### 2.2 **Port Registry Validation**
Verify `config/unified_mcp_port_registry.json` matches actual server configurations.

#### 2.3 **MCP Server Testing**
```bash
# Test MCP orchestrator in dry-run mode
python scripts/start_all_mcp_servers.py --dry-run
```

### **Phase 3: Infrastructure Prerequisites (Priority 3 - 1 Day)**

#### 3.1 **Docker Setup**
Ensure Docker is available in CI environment and locally:
```bash
docker --version
docker buildx version
```

#### 3.2 **UV Installation**
Verify UV is properly installed:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv --version
```

#### 3.3 **Node.js Dependencies**
Install infrastructure dependencies:
```bash
cd infrastructure
npm install
```

### **Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Priority 4 - 2 Days)**

#### 4.1 **Local Health Gate Testing**
```bash
# Test enhanced health gate locally
python scripts/ci/deployment_health_gate.py
```

#### 4.2 **Deployment Script Testing**
```bash
# Test deployment script in dry-run mode
python scripts/deploy_sophia_production.py --dry-run
```

#### 4.3 **GitHub Actions Validation**
- Create a test PR to trigger the workflow
- Verify all jobs execute successfully
- Check artifact collection and PR comments
