# 🚀 MCP Servers Strategic Modernization Plan

## Executive Summary
**Critical Status**: Only 6.2% of MCP servers are operational (2/32) with 36.7/100 average compliance score. This requires immediate strategic intervention to restore and modernize the entire ecosystem.

**Assessment Date**: 2025-06-30  
**Total Servers**: 32  
**Operational Rate**: 6.2% (2/32 servers)  
**Standardization Rate**: 25% (8/32 servers)  
**Average Compliance**: 36.7/100

## 🔴 Critical Issues Identified
