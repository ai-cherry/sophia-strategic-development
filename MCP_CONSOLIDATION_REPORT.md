- ❌ `enhanced_codacy_server.py` → Removed  
- ❌ `simple_codacy_server.py` → Removed
- ✅ `production_codacy_server.py` → **PRODUCTION READY**

### ✅ PRESERVED INDIVIDUAL SERVERS (Correct Decision):

#### **🎯 Project Management Servers (Each Serves Different Purpose)**
- ✅ **Asana** → Team task management and workflow automation
- ✅ **Linear** → Engineering project tracking and sprint management  
- ✅ **Notion** → Documentation, knowledge base, and content management

**Rationale:** These three servers serve distinct, non-overlapping purposes:
- **Asana:** Business-focused task management with workflow automation
- **Linear:** Engineering-focused project tracking with development integration
- **Notion:** Knowledge management and documentation platform

Consolidating these would eliminate valuable specialized functionality.

### Results:
- **Server Count:** 36+ → 27 (25% reduction achieved)
- **Redundancy Eliminated:** 9 servers consolidated/archived  
- **Specialized Tools Preserved:** Asana, Linear, Notion maintained for their unique purposes
- **Configuration Updated:** MCP configs reflect new structure
- **Development Focus:** All remaining servers prioritize dev assistance

### Next Steps:
1. **Phase 2:** Enhance core development servers (GitHub, Linear, Docker, Pulumi)
2. **Phase 3:** Create Development Intelligence Hub
3. **Phase 4:** Implement FastAPI best practices across all servers

### Archived Servers Location:
- `mcp-servers/_archived_snowflake/`
- `mcp-servers/_archived_slack/`
- `mcp-servers/_archived_sophia_intelligence/`
- `mcp-servers/_archived_hubspot/`

All archived servers are preserved and can be restored if needed.
