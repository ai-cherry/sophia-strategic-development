# Unified Orchestration Migration Plan
## Docker Swarm → K3s → Kubernetes

### Current State: Docker Swarm ✓
- **Status**: Production-ready with Docker Hub integration
- **Registry**: scoobyjava15 on Docker Hub
- **Deployment**: Single-node Swarm on Lambda Labs
- **Services**: 9 services with overlay networking

### Phase 1: Docker Swarm Optimization (Current)
```bash
# Deploy to Swarm with Docker Hub images
./unified_docker_hub_push.sh  # Build and push to Docker Hub
./unified_deployment.sh       # Deploy stack to Swarm
./unified_monitoring.sh       # Monitor services
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple deployment model
- Built-in load balancing
- Native Docker integration
- Minimal overhead

### Phase 2: K3s Migration (Next Step)
K3s is lightweight Kubernetes perfect for edge/IoT and our Lambda Labs setup.

**Migration Steps**:
1. Install K3s on Lambda Labs
   ```bash
   curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
   ```

2. Convert docker-compose to Kubernetes manifests
   ```bash
   # Use kompose for initial conversion
   kompose convert -f docker-compose.cloud.yml
   ```

3. Create Helm charts for better management
   ```yaml
   # sophia-ai/Chart.yaml
   apiVersion: v2
   name: sophia-ai
   version: 1.0.0
   ```

4. Deploy to K3s
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   # or with Helm
   helm install sophia-ai ./charts/sophia-ai
   ```

**Benefits**:
- Kubernetes API compatibility
- Lightweight (single binary)
- Built-in Traefik ingress
- Local storage support

### Phase 3: Full Kubernetes (Future)
For enterprise scale and multi-cloud deployment.

**Infrastructure**:
- EKS (AWS), GKE (Google), or AKS (Azure)
- Multi-node clusters
- Advanced networking (Istio/Linkerd)
- GitOps with ArgoCD/Flux

**Migration from K3s**:
```bash
# Export from K3s
kubectl get all -o yaml > k3s-export.yaml

# Apply to full K8s
kubectl apply -f k3s-export.yaml
```

### Unified Approach Benefits
1. **Consistent Images**: Same Docker Hub images across all platforms
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, scale as needed
3. **Skill Building**: Team learns Kubernetes gradually
4. **Cost Optimization**: Only pay for what you need

### Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Optimize Docker Swarm deployment ✓
- **Week 3-4**: Set up K3s in parallel
- **Week 5-6**: Migrate services to K3s
- **Month 2+**: Evaluate need for full K8s

### Key Files
- `docker-compose.cloud.yml` - Current Swarm config
- `k8s/` - Future Kubernetes manifests
- `charts/` - Helm charts for K3s/K8s
- `unified_k3s_migration.sh` - Migration script (to be created)

### Success Metrics
- Zero downtime during migration
- Consistent performance across platforms
- Simplified operations
- Cost-effective scaling
