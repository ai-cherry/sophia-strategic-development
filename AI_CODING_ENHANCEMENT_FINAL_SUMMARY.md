- ARG002: Unused arguments (589)
- Security issues (S-prefixed)
```

### Components Delivered

1. **Scripts Created:**
   - `scripts/fix_all_syntax_errors.py` - Comprehensive AST-based fixer
   - `scripts/fix_critical_syntax_errors.py` - Targeted critical fixes
   - `scripts/fix_syntax_errors_simple.py` - Direct console output version

2. **MCP Server:**
   - `backend/mcp_servers/ai_code_quality/` - Full AI code quality automation

3. **Services:**
   - `backend/services/ai_junk_prevention_service.py` - Junk file prevention

4. **Documentation:**
   - Comprehensive implementation plans and status reports
   - Ruff linting analysis report

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### AI Code Quality MCP Server
```python
# Natural language code operations
"Fix all syntax errors in backend/services/"
"Optimize import structure across the entire codebase"
"Remove unused arguments from all service classes"
"Apply security hardening to database connection code"
```

### Junk Prevention Patterns
```python
forbidden_patterns = {
    r".*_analysis_report\.md$",
    r".*_comprehensive_report\.md$",
    r"^scripts/one_time_.*\.py$",
    r".*\.backup$",
}
```

## 📈 Business Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **57.5% reduction** in code quality issues
