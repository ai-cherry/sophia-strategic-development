## 🛠️ Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Automated Security Management

**GitHub Actions Workflow for Security:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-automation.yml
name: Security Automation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly security updates
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  auto-merge-critical:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Auto-merge critical security PRs
        run: |
          # Auto-merge PRs with "Critical" severity
          # After automated testing passes
```

### 2. Dependency Management Strategy

**Version Pinning for Security:**
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
torch = "^2.7.1"      # Pin to secure version
gradio = "^5.31.0"    # Pin to secure version
urllib3 = "^2.5.0"    # Pin to secure version
requests = "^2.32.4"  # Pin to secure version
certifi = "^2024.7.4" # Pin to secure version
```

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting

**Security Monitoring Integration:**
```python
# Enhanced deployment-monitor.py
def security_health_check():
    """Check for known vulnerabilities in deployed packages"""
    # Scan for vulnerable package versions
    # Alert on critical/high severity findings
    # Auto-create GitHub issues for tracking
```
