# Shared Libraries - DO NOT USE YET

This directory is reserved for monorepo shared libraries.
Current shared code should remain in backend/core/ and backend/utils/.
See docs/monorepo/MONOREPO_TRANSITION_GUIDE.md for migration plan.

Created by Enhanced Dead Code Scanner to prevent accidental usage.
