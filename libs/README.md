# ⚠️ DO NOT USE THIS DIRECTORY YET

This `libs/` directory is part of the future monorepo structure but is **NOT YET ACTIVE**.

## Current Status: Not Ready for Use

- **Do NOT add shared libraries here**
- **Do NOT create new utilities here**
- **Continue using the old structure** (`backend/core/`, `backend/utils/`, etc.)

## What Will Go Here (In The Future)

When the monorepo migration is complete, this will contain:
- `libs/core/` - Core business logic (from `backend/core/`)
- `libs/ui/` - Shared UI components
- `libs/utils/` - Shared utilities
- `libs/types/` - Shared TypeScript types

## When Will This Be Ready?

- **Target Migration**: February 2025
- **Full Transition**: April 2025
