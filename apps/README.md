# ⚠️ DO NOT USE THIS DIRECTORY YET

This `apps/` directory is part of the future monorepo structure but is **NOT YET ACTIVE**.

## Current Status: Not Ready for Use

- **Do NOT add new code here**
- **Do NOT modify existing files here**
- **Continue using the old structure** (`backend/`, `frontend/`, etc.)

## Why This Exists

We are preparing for a transition to a monorepo structure that will:
- Improve build times from 15-20 min to <5 min
- Consolidate CI/CD workflows
- Unify dependency management

## When Will This Be Ready?

- **Target Migration**: February 2025
- **Full Transition**: April 2025

## For More Information

See the [Monorepo Transition Guide](../docs/monorepo/MONOREPO_TRANSITION_GUIDE.md)

**DO NOT USE UNTIL OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED**
