## 📋 Key Files Created

1. **local.env** - All credentials stored locally
2. **infrastructure_report.json** - Current infrastructure status
3. **k3s_cluster_config.json** - K3s cluster configuration
4. **INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive setup guide
5. **scripts/setup_infrastructure_comprehensive.py** - Master setup script
6. **scripts/setup_snowflake_infrastructure.py** - Modern Stack setup
7. **scripts/setup_lambda_labs_infrastructure.py** - Lambda Labs management
8. **scripts/update_github_secrets.py** - GitHub secrets updater

## 🚀 Deployment Scripts Generated

1. **deploy_k3s_lambda_labs.sh** - K3s installation on Lambda Labs
2. **deploy_mcp_lambda_labs.sh** - MCP server deployment

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Modern Stack Connection Issue
The PostgreSQL connector has a conflict with our project's Python path. To fix:
```bash
# Run Modern Stack scripts from outside project directory
cd /tmp && PYTHONPATH="" python /path/to/script.py
```

### Lambda Labs IPs
The Lambda Labs instances don't show public IPs via API. You'll need to:
1. Access via Lambda Labs dashboard
2. Or use SSH with your configured keys

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy K3s to Lambda Labs**:
   ```bash
   # SSH to primary instance and run:
   ./deploy_k3s_lambda_labs.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy MCP Servers**:
   ```bash
   # After K3s is ready:
   ./deploy_mcp_lambda_labs.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Modern Stack Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp && PYTHONPATH="" python scripts/setup_snowflake_infrastructure.py
   ```

4. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- Mix of RTX 6000, GH200, A6000, A100, A10
- Estimated monthly cost: $3,000-5,000 (requires pricing API fix)

## 🔒 Security Checklist

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ✅ All secrets in GitHub Organization/Pulumi ESC
- ✅ local.env in .gitignore
- ✅ PAT tokens for programmatic access
- ✅ MFA bypass for automation

## 📚 Documentation

All infrastructure is documented in:
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Setup procedures
