# APPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT PLAN
## Multi-Tiered Memory System - Infrastructure Focus Only

**Status:** APPROVED for Implementation
**Scope:** Infrastructure enhancements only (25% of original plan)
**Principle:** Build on existing systems, avoid tool proliferation

---

## **REJECTED COMPONENTS (Tool Duplication)**

❌ **Mem0 Integration** - Already implemented with AI Memory MCP Server + 5-tier memory
❌ **Knowledge Graph Integration** - L4 Knowledge Graph already exists
❌ **LangGraph Workflow Memory** - Multiple sophisticated LangGraph implementations deployed

**Reason:** These would violate our Tool Selection Principle: "Only add new tools when there's a clear gap that existing tools cannot fill"
