## Clean Architecture Implementation

We are implementing Clean Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture) to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability of the Sophia AI platform.

### Architecture Layers

1. **Domain Layer** (`backend/domain/`)
   - Business entities and logic
   - Technology-agnostic
   - No external dependencies

2. **Application Layer** (`backend/application/`)
   - Use cases and business workflows
   - Interfaces (ports) for external services
   - Orchestrates domain logic

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`backend/infrastructure/`)
   - Concrete implementations
   - External service adapters
   - Database repositories

4. **Presentation Layer** (`backend/presentation/`)
   - API endpoints and routing
   - Request/response handling
   - Data transformation

### Key Documents

- [Clean Architecture Guide](SOPHIA_AI_CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive implementation guide
- [Tech Stack Alignment](CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_TECH_STACK_ALIGNMENT.md) - How Clean Architecture aligns with our technology choices
- [Snowflake Cortex Refactoring Example](SNOWFLAKE_CORTEX_REFACTORING_EXAMPLE.md) - Practical example of decomposing a monolithic service
- [Architecture Audit Report](SOPHIA_AI_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_REPORT.md) - Analysis of current architecture and improvement plan
- [Phase 1 Implementation Report](PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md) - Progress on Clean Architecture implementation

### Technology Stack Integration

Our Clean Architecture implementation is designed to work seamlessly with:

- **Lambda Labs Servers** with Kubernetes (NOT AWS)
- **Snowflake** for data warehousing and AI/ML
- **Portkey** for unified LLM gateway
- **Estuary Flow** for real-time data integration
- **Pulumi** for infrastructure as code
- **Docker** with optimized multi-stage builds
- **Vercel** for frontend deployment
