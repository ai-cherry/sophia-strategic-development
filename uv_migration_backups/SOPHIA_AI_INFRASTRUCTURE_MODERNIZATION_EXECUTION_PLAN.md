from typing import List, Dict, Any

class InfrastructureModernizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.legacy_files = []
        self.migration_plan = {}
        
    def identify_legacy_components(self) -> List[str]:
        """Identify all legacy/broken MCP and Pulumi files"""
        legacy_patterns = [
            "infrastructure/**/*_old.py",
            "infrastructure/**/*_legacy.py",
            "mcp-servers/**/test_*.py",
            "infrastructure/pulumi/**/*.ts"  # TypeScript files to migrate
        ]
        # Implementation details...
        
    def standardize_to_python(self):
        """Migrate TypeScript infrastructure to Python"""
