## 🚀 **PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **Week 1-2: Foundation Setup**
```bash
# GOAL: Establish Clean Architecture structure
mkdir -p backend/{domain,use_cases,interfaces,infrastructure}

# Create domain entities
# Set up use case layer
# Implement dependency injection
# Establish testing framework
```

### **Week 3: Chat Service Decomposition**
```python
# TARGET: Break down SophiaUniversalChatService
# 1. Extract ChatOrchestrationUseCase (business logic)
# 2. Create WebSearchService (infrastructure)  
# 3. Build ResponseSynthesizerService (data transformation)
# 4. Implement UserProfileService (data access)
# 5. Wire everything through dependencies.py
```

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Chat functionality works with new architecture
- [ ] 80% reduction in service complexity achieved
- [ ] All tests pass with new structure
- [ ] No circular imports or deprecation warnings
- [ ] Clean separation of business logic from infrastructure
