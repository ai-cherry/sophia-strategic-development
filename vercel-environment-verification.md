# Vercel Environment Verification

## Build Configuration Analysis (2025-07-01 14:39 UTC)

### Current Build Settings:
- **Framework Preset:** Parcel ✅
- **Build Command:** `cd frontend && npm run build` ✅
- **Output Directory:** `frontend/dist` ✅
- **Install Command:** `npm ci` ✅
- **Development Command:** `parcel` ✅

### Project Details:
- **Project ID:** `prj_AtuvhI284XG3dyOWYEhvepguCjcu` ✅
- **Organization:** Lynn Musil's projects (Pro)
- **Repository:** ai-cherry/sophia-main ✅

### Critical Findings:

#### ✅ **Build Configuration is CORRECT**
All build settings match our requirements:
1. **Build Command:** Properly targets frontend directory
2. **Output Directory:** Correctly set to frontend/dist
3. **Framework:** Parcel preset is appropriate
4. **Install Command:** Standard npm ci

#### ❌ **Root Cause Confirmed**
The build configuration in Vercel dashboard is correct, which means the issue is definitely in the **vercel.json functions pattern** that we've already fixed in the repository.

### Next Steps Required:
1. **Check Environment Variables** - Verify all VITE_ variables are set
2. **Trigger New Deployment** - Force deployment with latest vercel.json
3. **Monitor Deployment Logs** - Watch for functions pattern errors

### Expected Resolution:
Since we've fixed the vercel.json functions pattern from `app/**/*.js` to individual Python files, the next deployment should succeed. The build configuration in Vercel is already correct.

### Deployment Strategy:
1. Use GitHub Actions "Force Vercel Deployment" workflow
2. Monitor deployment progress in real-time
3. Validate all API endpoints after successful deployment
4. Update monitoring to track ongoing health

This analysis confirms that our fixes should resolve the 95%+ failure rate once a new deployment is triggered with the corrected vercel.json configuration.
