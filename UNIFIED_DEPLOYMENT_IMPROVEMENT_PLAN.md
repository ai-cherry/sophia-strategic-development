# 🚀 Unified Deployment Improvement Plan

**Date:** January 14, 2025
**Status:** Critical - Multiple competing deployment systems causing confusion
**Goal:** One badass deployment path with zero duplication

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Deployment Workflows (3 Competing Systems)
1. **production-deployment.yml** - "Full stack" pipeline with quality gates, IaC, build & push, SSH + Swarm deploy
2. **deploy_v2_mcp_servers.yml** - Builds & ships V2 MCP images with parallel matrix builds
3. **deploy-sophia-platform.yml** - Multi-environment deployment (not in active use)

### Docker Compose Files (2 Versions)
1. **docker-compose.cloud.yml** - Original Swarm stack (474 lines)
2. **docker-compose.cloud.v2.yml** - V2 with parameterized images (exists but not shown)

### Deployment Scripts (15+ Ad-hoc)
- `one_command_deploy.sh` - Lambda Labs one-command deployment
- `lambda_labs_deployment.sh` - Multi-instance deployment
- `deploy_phase1_optimizations.sh` - HA optimization deployment
- `prepare_deployment_package.sh` - Package builder
- `deploy_production_complete.py` - Python deployment orchestrator
- `deploy_to_lambda_labs.sh` - Basic deployment
- `unified_lambda_labs_deployment.py` - Unified deployment (referenced but missing?)
- Plus 8+ other scripts with overlapping functionality

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Pulumi TypeScript**: `infrastructure/pulumi/` with Lambda Labs provisioning
- **Pulumi Python**: Various wrapper scripts
- **Vercel Pulumi**: `infrastructure/vercel/` for frontend deployment

### Pain Points Identified
1. **THREE workflows doing 80% the same thing**
2. **Manual SSH + docker stack deploy** violates Golden Rule
3. **Duplicated build logic** across workflows
4. **Mixed secret management** (GitHub Secrets, Pulumi ESC, Docker Secrets)
5. **No single source of truth** for deployment configuration
6. **Frontend deployment duplicated** in workflows and Python scripts

## 🎯 Target Architecture: "One Badass Path"

### Single Workflow: `.github/workflows/sophia-unified-deployment.yml`

```yaml
name: 🚀 Sophia Unified Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        type: choice
        options: [production, staging, development]
        default: production
      deploy_backend:
        type: boolean
        default: true
      deploy_mcp:
        type: boolean
        default: true
      deploy_frontend:
        type: boolean
        default: true
      deploy_monitoring:
        type: boolean
        default: false

env:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: scoobyjava15
  PULUMI_ORG: scoobyjava-org

jobs:
  # 1. Quality Gate (Reusable)
  quality-gate:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable/quality-gate.yml

  # 2. Build Matrix (Smart Detection)
  build:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable/build-and-push.yml
    with:
      backend: ${{ inputs.deploy_backend }}
      mcp_servers: ${{ inputs.deploy_mcp }}

  # 3. Infrastructure (Pulumi)
  infrastructure:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable/pulumi-deploy.yml
    with:
      environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
    secrets: inherit

  # 4. Deploy Stack (Composite)
  deploy:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable/swarm-deploy.yml
    needs: [build, infrastructure]
    with:
      compose_file: docker-compose.unified.yml
      environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}

  # 5. Frontend (Vercel)
  frontend:
    if: inputs.deploy_frontend
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable/vercel-deploy.yml
    needs: deploy

  # 6. Validation
  validate:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable/validate-deployment.yml
    needs: [deploy, frontend]
```

### Unified Docker Compose: `docker-compose.unified.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.8"

x-default-deploy: &default-deploy
  mode: replicated
  replicas: ${REPLICAS:-2}
  update_config:
    parallelism: 1
    delay: 10s
    failure_action: rollback
  restart_policy:
    condition: on-failure
    delay: 5s
    max_attempts: 3

x-default-healthcheck: &default-healthcheck
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 60s

services:
  # Backend (with environment interpolation)
  backend:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY}/sophia-ai:${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}
    <<: *default-deploy
    healthcheck:
      <<: *default-healthcheck
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]

  # MCP Services (generated from directory scan)
  ${MCP_SERVICES}

  # Infrastructure services...
```

## 📋 Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Consolidate & Delete (Week 1) ⚡
**Goal:** Remove duplication, establish single source of truth

1. **Archive Legacy Workflows**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows/archive
   mv .github/workflows/deploy-mcp-production.yml .github/workflows/archive/
   mv .github/workflows/deploy-sophia-platform.yml .github/workflows/archive/
   ```

2. **Delete Redundant Scripts**
   ```bash
   # Archive but don't delete (for reference)
   mkdir -p scripts/archive/deployment
   mv scripts/deploy_sophia_platform.sh scripts/archive/deployment/
   mv scripts/focused_deployment.sh scripts/archive/deployment/
   mv scripts/one_command_deploy.sh scripts/archive/deployment/
   ```

3. **Consolidate Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   # Merge cloud.yml and cloud.v2.yml into unified version
   cp docker-compose.cloud.yml docker-compose.unified.yml
   # Add parameterization from v2
   ```

### Phase 2: Create Reusable Components (Week 1) 🛠️

1. **Composite Actions**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows/reusable
   ```

   Create:
   - `quality-gate.yml` - Linting, testing, security
   - `build-and-push.yml` - Matrix builds with caching
   - `pulumi-deploy.yml` - Infrastructure provisioning
   - `swarm-deploy.yml` - Stack deployment
   - `vercel-deploy.yml` - Frontend deployment
   - `validate-deployment.yml` - Health checks

2. **Unified Scripts**
   ```bash
   # Create single deployment orchestrator
   scripts/deploy_sophia_unified.py
   ```

### Phase 3: Implement Unified Workflow (Week 2) 🚀

1. **Create Main Workflow**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/sophia-unified-deployment.yml
   # Implements 6-stage pipeline with reusable components
   ```

2. **Smart MCP Detection**
   ```python
   # Auto-detect MCP servers from directory structure
   mcp_servers = glob.glob("infrastructure/mcp_servers/*_v2")
   ```

3. **Environment-Aware Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # Single compose file with environment interpolation
   ENVIRONMENT=${ENV:-production}
   REPLICAS=${REPLICAS_BACKEND:-3}
   ```

### Phase 4: Frontend & Edge (Week 2) 🌐

1. **Pulumi Vercel Resources**
   ```typescript
   // infrastructure/vercel/index.ts
   const deployment = new vercel.Deployment("sophia-frontend", {
     projectId: project.id,
     production: env === "production"
   });
   ```

2. **Remove Manual Vercel CLI**
   - Delete `deploy_sophia_intel_ai.py`
   - Use Pulumi or GitHub Action only

### Phase 5: Observability & Rollback (Week 3) 🔍

1. **Automated Rollback**
   ```yaml
   rollback:
     if: failure()
     run: |
       docker stack deploy -c last-known-good.yml sophia-ai
   ```

2. **Deployment Tracking**
   ```python
   # Track deployment versions in Snowflake
   INSERT INTO deployments (version, timestamp, status)
   ```

### Phase 6: Documentation & Training (Week 3) 📚

1. **Update System Handbook**
   - New deployment architecture
   - Runbook for production issues
   - Rollback procedures

2. **Create Architecture Diagram**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
     GitHub[GitHub Push] --> GHA[GitHub Actions]
     GHA --> Quality[Quality Gate]
     Quality --> Build[Matrix Build]
     Build --> Pulumi[Pulumi IaC]
     Pulumi --> Swarm[Docker Swarm]
     Swarm --> Vercel[Vercel Edge]
     Vercel --> Validate[Validation]
   ```

## 🛠️ Implementation Commands

### Quick Start (Today)
```bash
# 1. Create unified compose file
cp docker-compose.cloud.yml docker-compose.unified.yml

# 2. Create reusable actions directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows/reusable

# 3. Archive old workflows
mkdir -p .github/workflows/archive
mv .github/workflows/deploy-mcp-production.yml .github/workflows/archive/

# 4. Create first reusable action
cat > .github/workflows/reusable/quality-gate.yml << 'EOF'
name: Quality Gate
on:
  workflow_call:

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
      - name: Run checks
        run: |
          uv sync --group dev
          uv run ruff check .
          uv run pytest
EOF
```

### Migration Path
1. **Week 1**: Run new workflow in parallel with old
2. **Week 2**: Switch to new workflow as primary
3. **Week 3**: Delete old workflows
4. **Week 4**: Full production validation

## 📝 Key Decisions

1. **Docker Swarm stays** - No K8s migration needed for current scale
2. **Pulumi for everything** - IaC for infrastructure AND deployments
3. **GitHub Actions only** - No local scripts for production
4. **Composite actions** - Reusability and consistency
5. **Single compose file** - With environment interpolation

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing deployments | High | Run in parallel first |
| Missing edge cases | Medium | Comprehensive testing |
| Team adoption | Low | Clear documentation |
| Rollback complexity | High | Automated rollback job |

## 🎉 Expected Outcomes

After implementation:
- **One clear deployment path** everyone understands
- **Zero manual steps** in production deployments
- **Consistent environments** across dev/staging/prod
- **Fast, reliable deployments** with automatic rollback
- **Happy developers** who aren't debugging deployment issues

---

**Next Step:** Start with Phase 1 - consolidate and delete duplicates. The path to deployment excellence begins with removing confusion!
