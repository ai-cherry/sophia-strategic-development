## 🔧 **FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT RESOLUTION**

### **Issue Encountered:**
- Complex React/Node.js build failed on ARM64 Lambda Labs architecture
- Rollup dependencies incompatible with ARM64 platform
- 180-second timeout during file transfer

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Simple HTML Approach**: Created self-contained HTML/CSS/JS frontend
2. **Direct Deployment**: Bypassed Node.js build entirely
3. **Permission Fix**: Resolved nginx 500 error with proper file permissions
4. **API Integration**: Maintained full API connectivity with backend

### **Technical Resolution Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Created simple HTML frontend (15KB single file)
# 2. Deployed directly to /home/ubuntu/sophia-ai/frontend-simple/
# 3. Fixed permissions: chmod 644 index.html, 755 directories
# 4. Configured nginx proxy for API routes
# 5. Verified: Frontend (200) + API (200) = Full functionality
```
