# Docstring Fixer Script

## Overview
The `fix_all_docstrings.py` script automatically fixes Python docstring formatting issues to ensure compliance with PEP 257 standards.

## What it fixes
1. **Missing periods**: Adds periods to single-line docstrings that don't end with proper punctuation (., !, ?, :)
2. **Missing blank lines**: Ensures multi-line docstrings have a blank line after the summary line
3. **Formatting consistency**: Maintains proper indentation and structure

## Usage

### Fix a single file
```bash
python scripts/fix_all_docstrings.py path/to/file.py
```

### Fix all Python files in a directory
```bash
python scripts/fix_all_docstrings.py path/to/directory/
```

### Fix multiple files or directories
```bash
python scripts/fix_all_docstrings.py file1.py file2.py directory1/ directory2/
```

### Fix entire backend
```bash
python scripts/fix_all_docstrings.py backend/
```

## Examples

### Before
```python
def example():
    """This is a docstring without period"
    pass

def multiline():
    """Summary line
    Details without blank line after summary."""
    pass
```

### After
```python
def example():
    """This is a docstring without period."
    pass

def multiline():
    """Summary line.
    
    Details without blank line after summary."""
    pass
```

## Safety Features
- Only modifies docstrings, not other code
- Preserves existing formatting where correct
- Reports which files were modified
- Handles both `"""` and `'''` style docstrings
- Robust error handling for file I/O

## Technical Details
- Uses regex pattern matching to identify docstrings
- Preserves indentation and code structure
- Handles edge cases like empty docstrings
- Compatible with Python 3.x
