Sales Rep: Thanks for joining the call today. I wanted to discuss how Pay Ready can help with your business intelligence needs.

Customer: Yes, we're currently evaluating several solutions. We're also looking at FastTrack BI and DataFlow Analytics.

Sales Rep: I understand. What specific challenges are you facing with your current setup?

Customer: Our biggest frustration is that we can't export data in real-time to our BI tools. We need to run manual exports every day, which is really inefficient. Also, we're using your platform for compliance auditing, which wasn't something we initially planned but it's working really well.

Sales Rep: That's great to hear about the compliance use case. Regarding the export limitation, let me show you our API capabilities...

Customer: The API sounds good, but honestly, the $60,000 price tag for the Enterprise tier is a bit steep for us right now. Is there any flexibility there?

Sales Rep: Let me discuss with my manager about potential options for you...
