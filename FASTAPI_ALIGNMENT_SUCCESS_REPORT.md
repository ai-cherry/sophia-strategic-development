## üõ†Ô∏è Issues Resolved

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **IndentationError in simple_fastapi.py** - ‚úÖ Fixed all syntax errors
2. **Missing Dependencies** - ‚úÖ Installed SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, uvicorn, Redis
3. **Import Chain Failures** - ‚úÖ Removed problematic imports, streamlined dependencies  
4. **Inconsistent Patterns** - ‚úÖ Aligned all applications to common standards
5. **Environment Configuration** - ‚úÖ Standardized environment variable handling

### Alignment Standards Applied:
- **Consistent Logging:** All use structured logging with timestamps
- **Standard Middleware:** CORS, error handlers, startup/shutdown events
- **Unified Health Checks:** Comprehensive health and status endpoints
- **Environment Awareness:** All support ENVIRONMENT and DEBUG configuration
- **Error Handling:** Consistent exception handlers with proper JSON responses
- **Port Management:** Each application runs on dedicated port (8000-8003)
