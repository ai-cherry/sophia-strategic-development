## 🏗 Architecture Foundation

### Established Patterns
1. **Simple FastAPI servers** with minimal dependencies
2. **Standardized health endpoints** (/health)
3. **Consistent API patterns** (/api/v1/...)
4. **ESC integration** for configuration
5. **Comprehensive error handling**
6. **Structured logging**

### Port Management Strategy
- **8000**: API Gateway (main entry point)
- **9001**: AI Memory (development context)
- **3008**: Codacy (code quality)
- **9003**: GitHub (repository management)
- **9004**: Linear (project management)

## 💼 Business Impact

### Development Velocity
