## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Real-Time Data Flow

```
External System → Webhook/API → Sophia Backend → Snowflake Stream → Processing → Analytics
```

Example: Gong call recording flow:
1. Gong sends webhook with call data
2. Sophia validates and enriches data
3. Data inserted into RAW_GONG_CALLS table
4. Stream captures changes
5. Task processes and transforms data
6. Results available in PROCESSED_CALLS view

### 2. Batch Processing Flow

```
Source System → Staging Files → Snowflake Stage → COPY INTO → Transformation → Production
```

Example: HubSpot sync flow:
1. Daily extraction from HubSpot API
2. JSON files staged in S3
3. Snowflake external stage references S3
4. COPY INTO loads to staging tables
5. dbt transformations clean and enrich
6. Merge into production tables

### 3. AI Processing Flow

```
Raw Data → Cortex Processing → Vector Store → Semantic Search → Insights
```

Example: Call intelligence flow:
1. Raw transcript from Gong
2. Cortex SUMMARIZE function creates summary
3. Cortex EMBED_TEXT generates embeddings
4. Vectors stored in EMBEDDINGS table
5. Similarity search finds related calls

## Snowflake Features Utilized

### 1. Cortex AI Functions

```sql
-- Sentiment Analysis
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(transcript) as sentiment_score
FROM gong_calls;

-- Summarization
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(transcript) as call_summary
FROM gong_calls;

-- Text Completion
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'mistral-large',
    'Generate action items from: ' || transcript
) as action_items
FROM gong_calls;
```

### 2. Streams and Tasks

```sql
-- Change data capture stream
CREATE STREAM gong_calls_stream ON TABLE gong_calls;

-- Automated processing task
CREATE TASK process_gong_calls
  WAREHOUSE = WH_SOPHIA_STREAMING
  SCHEDULE = '1 MINUTE'
WHEN
  SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('gong_calls_stream')
AS
  CALL process_call_insights();
```

### 3. Dynamic Tables

```sql
-- Real-time aggregations
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE customer_health_scores
  LAG = '1 minute'
  WAREHOUSE = WH_SOPHIA_STREAMING
AS
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
    COUNT(DISTINCT call_id) as total_calls,
    MAX(call_date) as last_interaction
FROM processed_calls
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 4. Zero-Copy Cloning

Used for creating development environments:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE SOPHIA_AI_DEV CLONE SOPHIA_AI_PROD;
```

### 5. Time Travel

For data recovery and auditing:
```sql
SELECT * FROM gong_calls AT(TIMESTAMP => '2024-01-01 00:00:00');
```

## Security and Access Control

### 1. Role Hierarchy

```
ACCOUNTADMIN
└── SOPHIA_AI_ADMIN (Full control)
    ├── SOPHIA_AI_DEVELOPER (Dev access)
    ├── SOPHIA_AI_ANALYST (Read access)
    └── SOPHIA_AI_AGENT_SERVICE (Service account)
```

### 2. Row-Level Security

```sql
-- Customer data access policy
CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY customer_access_policy
AS (customer_id VARCHAR) RETURNS BOOLEAN ->
  CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('SOPHIA_AI_ADMIN') OR
  customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id 
    FROM user_customer_mapping 
    WHERE user_name = CURRENT_USER()
  );
```

### 3. Dynamic Data Masking

```sql
-- PII masking policy
CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS (val STRING) 
RETURNS STRING ->
  CASE
    WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('SOPHIA_AI_ADMIN') THEN val
    ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(val, '.+@', '****@')
  END;
```

### 4. Network Policies

Restricting access to authorized IPs:
```sql
CREATE NETWORK POLICY sophia_network_policy
  ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.0/24', '10.0.0.0/8')
  BLOCKED_IP_LIST = ('0.0.0.0/0');
```

    """
    if query_complexity == "simple" and data_volume < 1_000_000:
        return "X-SMALL"
    elif query_complexity == "moderate" or data_volume < 10_000_000:
        return "SMALL"
    elif query_complexity == "complex" or data_volume < 100_000_000:
        return "MEDIUM"
    else:
        return "LARGE"
```

    query_text,
    user_name,
    warehouse_name,
    total_elapsed_time,
    bytes_scanned
FROM table(information_schema.query_history())
WHERE total_elapsed_time > 30000  -- 30 seconds
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```

### 2. Warehouse Utilization

```sql
-- Warehouse credit usage
SELECT 
    warehouse_name,
    SUM(credits_used) as total_credits,
    AVG(avg_running) as avg_queries
FROM table(information_schema.warehouse_metering_history())
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY warehouse_name;
```

### 3. Storage Monitoring

```sql
-- Table storage metrics
SELECT 
    table_catalog,
    table_schema,
    table_name,
    bytes,
    row_count
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_catalog = 'SOPHIA_AI_PROD'
ORDER BY bytes DESC;
```

## Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Connection Errors

```python
async def execute_with_retry(query: str, max_retries: int = 3):
    """
    Retry logic for transient connection errors
    """
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return await execute_query(query)
        except SnowflakeConnectionError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

### 2. Query Timeouts

```python
# Set query timeout
cursor.execute("ALTER SESSION SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS = 300")

# Handle timeout gracefully
try:
    cursor.execute(long_running_query)
except SnowflakeQueryTimeout:
    # Log and notify
    logger.error("Query timeout - consider optimization")
    # Fallback to cached results or simplified query
```

### 3. Data Quality Issues

```python
# Validate data before insertion
def validate_gong_call(call_data: dict) -> bool:
    """
    Ensure data quality before Snowflake insertion
    """
    required_fields = ['call_id', 'customer_id', 'timestamp']
    
    # Check required fields
    if not all(field in call_data for field in required_fields):
        return False
        
    # Validate data types
    if not isinstance(call_data['timestamp'], (int, str)):
        return False
        
    # Business logic validation
    if call_data.get('duration', 0) < 0:
        return False
        
    return True
```
