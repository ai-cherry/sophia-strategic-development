## Overview

The Sophia AI Knowledge Ingestion & Curation System provides a comprehensive framework for building and maintaining Pay Ready's intelligent knowledge base. This system combines manual document management, automated insight discovery from Gong calls, and interactive curation tools to ensure the knowledge base remains accurate, relevant, and continuously improving.

## Architecture

```python
# Example usage:
python
```python

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Format Document Upload
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, Word (DOC/DOCX), Excel (XLS/XLSX), Text (TXT), CSV, Markdown (MD)
- **Drag-and-drop interface** for easy bulk uploads
- **Automatic text extraction** and parsing
- **Metadata tagging** for categorization

### 2. Proactive Discovery Queue
- **Automated Gong transcript analysis** using AI
- **Intelligent insight extraction** for:
  - New competitors
  - Product gaps and limitations
  - Unexpected use cases
  - Pricing objections
  - Feature requests
  - Integration needs
  - Security concerns
- **Human-in-the-loop validation** before adding to knowledge base
- **Confidence scoring** for each discovered insight

### 3. Knowledge Curation Chat
- **Natural language interface** for testing knowledge base
- **Source citation** for every response
- **Interactive feedback mechanism**:
  - Thumbs up for correct information
  - Thumbs down with correction capability
- **Immediate knowledge base updates** based on feedback

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
# Example usage:
bash
```python
import requests

files = [
    ('files', open('pricing_guide.pdf', 'rb')),
    ('files', open('product_specs.docx', 'rb'))
]
data = {
    'category': 'products_services',
    'tags': 'pricing,products,2024'
}

response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:8000/api/knowledge/documents/upload',
    files=files,
    data=data
)
```python
# Example usage:
python
```python
response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:8000/api/knowledge/curation/chat',
    json={'query': 'What is our Enterprise pricing?'}
)

print(response.json())
# {
#   "content": "The Enterprise Tier is priced at $60,000 per year...",
#   "source": "product_pricing.txt",
#   "confidence": 0.95,
#   "needsFeedback": true
# }
```python
# Example usage:
python
```python
# CEO Dashboard query flow
User: "What are the risks for QuantumLeap Solutions?"

1. Query ClientHealthAgent for real-time data
2. Query Knowledge Base for competitor intel
3. Synthesize comprehensive response
4. Present with actionable insights
```python
# Example usage:
python
```bash
# Test knowledge base connection
python -m backend.knowledge_base.vector_store test

# Check pending insights
curl http://localhost:8000/api/knowledge/insights/pending

# Verify document count
curl http://localhost:8000/api/knowledge/analytics/stats
```python

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access for sensitive documents
2. **Data Encryption**: All documents encrypted at rest
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all changes and access
4. **API Authentication**: Secure all endpoints with proper auth

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Knowledge Extraction** from:
   - Email threads
   - Slack conversations
   - Support tickets

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Knowledge gap analysis
   - Usage patterns
   - ROI tracking

3. **AI-Powered Suggestions**:
   - Proactive document recommendations
   - Auto-categorization
   - Duplicate detection
