**Approach:** Break monolithic functions into focused helper methods
**Benefits:** Improved readability, easier testing, better organization

### 2. Strategy Pattern (High Complexity)
**Target:** 247 functions with complexity >8
**Approach:** Replace complex conditional logic with strategy classes
**Benefits:** Reduced complexity, easier to extend, better separation

### 3. Builder Pattern (Many Parameters)
**Target:** 32 functions with >8 parameters
**Approach:** Replace parameter lists with fluent builder interface
**Benefits:** Improved usability, better validation, cleaner APIs

### 4. Template Method Pattern (Large Initializations)
**Target:** Large `__init__` methods and setup functions
**Approach:** Structure initialization with defined workflow steps
**Benefits:** Consistent structure, easier maintenance, reduced duplication
