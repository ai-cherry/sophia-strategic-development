name: Sophia Intelligence Orchestrator
on:
  push:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours

jobs:
  deploy_intelligence:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: AI-Powered Deployment
        run: |
          python -m sophia.infrastructure.deploy \
            --mode=intelligent \
            --target=production \
            --features=all
```

### **Phase 3: Business Intelligence Deployment (Week 3-4)**

#### 3.1 Competitive Intelligence
```python
# backend/services/competitive_intelligence.py
class CompetitiveIntelligenceService:
    """Real-time competitor monitoring"""
    
    async def monitor_competitors(self):
        return {
            "elise_ai": await self.track_elise_ai(),
            "hunter_warfield": await self.track_hunter_warfield(),
            "market_moves": await self.analyze_market_changes()
        }
```

#### 3.2 NMHC Top 50 Integration
```python
# backend/services/nmhc_targeting.py
class NMHCTargetingService:
    """NMHC Top 50 prospect intelligence"""
    
    async def enrich_prospects(self):
        prospects = await self.fetch_nmhc_top_50()
        enriched = await self.enrich_with_apollo()
        scored = await self.score_opportunities()
        return self.prioritize_outreach(enriched, scored)
```

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation Strategy

### 1. **Parallel Testing**
- Run new infrastructure alongside legacy for 2 weeks
- A/B test performance and reliability
- Gradual traffic shifting (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)

### 2. **Automated Rollback**
```yaml
# infrastructure/rollback/emergency.yaml
rollback_triggers:
  - error_rate > 5%
  - latency_p95 > 500ms
  - cost_spike > 20%
  
rollback_actions:
  - restore_previous_stack
  - notify_oncall
  - create_incident
```

### 3. **Business Continuity**
- Maintain manual fallback procedures
- Document all critical paths
- Train team on emergency procedures
