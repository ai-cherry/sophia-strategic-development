## Refactoring Strategies by Pattern

### 1. Extract Method Pattern (Primary Strategy)
**Apply to:** 892 long functions
**Benefits:** Improved readability, easier testing, better code organization

**Example Transformation:**
```python
# BEFORE: 65-line smart_recall_enhanced
async def smart_recall_enhanced(self, request: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # 65 lines of mixed logic...

# AFTER: Refactored with helper methods (15 lines main + 6 helpers)
async def smart_recall_enhanced(self, request: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Enhanced memory recall with AI ranking and context awareness"""
    try:
        query_context = await self._prepare_query_context(request)
        enhanced_query = await self._enhance_query_with_ai(query_context)
        raw_memories = await self._search_memories(enhanced_query, request)
        ranked_memories = await self._rank_memories_with_ai(raw_memories, query_context)
        
        return self._format_recall_response(ranked_memories, enhanced_query)
    except Exception as e:
        return self._handle_recall_error(e)
```

### 2. Strategy Pattern (For High Complexity)
**Apply to:** 247 functions with high cyclomatic complexity
**Benefits:** Reduced complexity, easier to extend, better separation of concerns

### 3. Builder Pattern (For Many Parameters)
**Apply to:** 32 functions with >8 parameters
**Benefits:** Improved API usability, better parameter validation, cleaner code

### 4. Template Method Pattern (For Large Initializations)
**Apply to:** Large `__init__` methods and setup functions
**Benefits:** Consistent structure, easier maintenance, reduced duplication
