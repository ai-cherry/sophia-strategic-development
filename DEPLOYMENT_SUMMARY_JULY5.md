# Sophia AI Deployment Summary
## Date: July 5, 2025

### ✅ Deployment Status: OPERATIONAL

## Services Running

### Backend Services
- **Main Backend**: http://localhost:8003
  - Status: ✅ Healthy
  - Health Check: `{"status":"healthy","service":"sophia-backend","timestamp":"2025-07-06T05:51:22.446374"}`

### Frontend
- **Unified Dashboard**: http://localhost:5174
  - Status: ✅ Running
  - Framework: Vite + React
  - Note: Running on port 5174 (5173 was in use)

### MCP Servers
- **Lambda Labs CLI MCP**: ✅ Running (PID: 59557)
- **Snowflake CLI Enhanced MCP**: ✅ Running (PID: 59889)
- Additional MCP servers started by activation script

### Infrastructure Status
- **Docker Image**: Built successfully (`sophia-ai:latest`)
- **Pulumi Infrastructure**: Partial deployment (ESC environment needs configuration)
- **Local Development**: Fully operational

## Access Points

1. **Dashboard**: Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser
2. **Backend API**: http://localhost:8003
3. **Health Check**: http://localhost:8003/health
4. **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8003/docs

## Deployment Method Used

Due to Pulumi ESC configuration requirements, deployed using:
1. Docker build for containerization
2. Local activation script (`scripts/activate_sophia_production.py`)
3. Direct npm dev server for frontend

## Next Steps for Full Cloud Deployment

1. Configure Pulumi ESC environment:
   - Create `scoobyjava-org/default/sophia-ai-production` environment
   - Add all required secrets from GitHub organization secrets

2. Deploy to Lambda Labs:
   - Run `pulumi up` after ESC configuration
   - Deploy containers to Lambda Labs instances

3. Configure Kubernetes:
   - Apply manifests from `kubernetes/` directory
   - Set up ingress for external access

## Current Limitations

- Running locally instead of on Lambda Labs cloud
- No external access (localhost only)
- Manual process instead of automated CI/CD

## Business Impact

- ✅ Full functionality available for development and testing
- ✅ All core services operational
- ⚠️ Not accessible externally (cloud deployment pending)

## Commands to Verify

```bash
# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:8003/health

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep -E "sophia|mcp" | grep -v grep

# View frontend
open http://localhost:5174
```

**Status**: Development environment fully deployed and operational. Cloud deployment requires Pulumi ESC configuration.
