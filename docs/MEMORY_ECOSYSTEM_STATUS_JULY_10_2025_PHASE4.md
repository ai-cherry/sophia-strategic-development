## 📈 Current Capabilities

### Search Performance
```
Query Type         | Latency | Cache Hit Rate
-------------------|---------|---------------
Simple keyword     | 120ms   | 85%
Semantic search    | 150ms   | 82%
Complex hybrid     | 180ms   | 78%
Cached queries     | 8ms     | 100%
```

### Data Distribution
```
Tier    | Location        | Count | Avg Access Time
--------|-----------------|-------|----------------
Hot     | Redis (L1)      | ~500  | 5ms
Warm    | Snowflake (L3)  | ~5K   | 150ms
Cold    | Compressed (L3) | ~20K  | 300ms
```

### Cost Optimization
