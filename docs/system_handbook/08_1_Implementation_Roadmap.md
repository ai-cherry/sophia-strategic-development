## 1. Guiding Principle

This roadmap translates the architectural vision outlined in the **Sophia AI System Handbook** into a concrete, phased implementation plan. It prioritizes impact and foundational stability, ensuring that each phase delivers measurable value and builds upon a robust core. This is a living document that will be updated as we complete each phase.

## 2. The Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Phoenix Gateway (Complete)**

-   **Impact:** Resurrected the MCP ecosystem from 0% to a functional state. Established N8N as the central orchestration gateway, solving the core protocol mismatch and providing a scalable foundation for all future tools.
-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   ✅ N8N MCP Gateway (`n8n_mcp_gateway.py`)
    -   ✅ Functional `analyze_code` Tool
    -   ✅ Functional `store_memory` & `recall_memory` Tools
    -   ✅ Functional `execute_snowflake_query` Tool
    -   ✅ Functional Project Management Suite (`Linear`, `Asana`, `Notion`, `Slack`)
    -   ✅ AI Pattern Selector (`recommend_repository_pattern`)
    -   ✅ Proactive Self-Healing & Monitoring Workflow

### **Phase 2: Enterprise Supremacy (Current Focus)**

-   **Impact:** Harden the N8N-based ecosystem for enterprise-wide production use, focusing on security, scalability, and observability.
-   **Key Initiatives:**
    1.  **Deploy N8N in Queue Mode:** Reconfigure the N8N Docker deployment for high-throughput, horizontally-scalable production workloads to handle hundreds of concurrent AI agent requests.
    2.  **Centralize Observability:** Create a comprehensive Grafana dashboard. Pipe all N8N execution logs, MCP gateway metrics, and internal service health checks into this dashboard for a single-pane-of-glass view of the entire system's health.
    3.  **Implement Enterprise Security:** Enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within N8N. Create credential mappings and workflows that ensure AI agents and users can only access the tools and data appropriate for their role (e.g., CEO, Sales, Engineering).

### **Phase 3: Interactive Intelligence**

-   **Impact:** Bring the full vision of our contextualized memory and interactive training architecture to life, transforming Sophia from a tool into a true learning partner.
-   **Key Initiatives:**
    1.  **Build the Ingestion Pipeline:** Implement the UI-based and automated ingestion workflows for getting knowledge into the system (from file uploads, Slack channels, Gong calls, etc.). This includes building out the chunking, meta-tagging, and embedding processes.
    2.  **Activate the Training Loop:** Develop the UI components and backend logic for the natural language training interface.
    3.  **Implement the User Impact Model:** Build the system for the CEO to assign "Training Impact Scores" to users. This involves updating the user model in the database and modifying the LLM prompt synthesizer to prioritize knowledge from high-impact users.

### **Phase 4: CRM Modernization**

-   **Impact:** Execute the phased migration from Salesforce to the modern, AI-native HubSpot and Intercom stack, unlocking significant cost savings and developer agility.
-   **Key Initiatives:**
    1.  **Execute Phase 1 (Dual-Write & Sync):** Build and deploy the N8N workflow to mirror Salesforce data into HubSpot and Intercom.
    2.  **Execute Phase 2 (Shift Reads):** Refactor all Sophia AI dashboards and services to read from the new CRM stack.
    3.  **Execute Phase 3 (Shift Writes):** Implement the dual-write N8N workflow and begin piloting the new system with a core group of users.
    4.  **Execute Phase 4 (Final Cutover):** Onboard all users to the new system and formally decommission Salesforce.

### **Phase 5: Continuous Advancement**

-   **Impact:** Ongoing innovation to maintain Sophia AI's position as a world-class AI orchestration platform.
-   **Key Initiatives (Ongoing):**
    1.  **Expand the Toolset:** Continuously add new tools to the N8N gateway, focusing on high-value integrations and patterns from our strategic repository collection.
    2.  **Evolve the UI:** Enhance the Universal Chat Interface and dashboards based on user feedback.
    3.  **Optimize Performance:** Regularly review system performance metrics and optimize bottlenecks in N8N workflows, database queries, and AI model routing.
    4.  **Refine the Training Model:** Evolve the user impact model to support context-specific expertise (e.g., weighting a sales leader's input higher on sales-related topics).
