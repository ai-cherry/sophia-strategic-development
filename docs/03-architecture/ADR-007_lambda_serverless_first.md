# ADR-007: Lambda Labs Serverless-First Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Sophia AI currently runs on dedicated Lambda Labs GPU instances (GH200) at approximately $6,444/month. Analysis of workload patterns shows:
- 80% of requests are simple completions requiring < 2 seconds
- 20% are complex analytics requiring sustained GPU performance
- Peak usage occurs during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)
- Overnight and weekend usage is minimal

Lambda Labs now offers serverless inference with:
- Pay-per-token pricing (no idle costs)
- Multiple model options with different price/performance ratios
- OpenAI-compatible API
- Automatic scaling

## Decision
Adopt a serverless-first hybrid architecture:
- **80% serverless**: Route simple queries and non-latency-critical workloads to serverless API
- **20% GPU**: Maintain 2 dedicated GPU instances for latency-critical and complex workloads
- **Intelligent routing**: Use complexity analysis and cost priorities to select optimal backend
- **Automatic fallback**: Fail over between backends for high availability

## Consequences

### Positive
- **85-93% cost reduction**: From $6,444/month to ~$800/month
- **Infinite scale**: Handle traffic spikes without provisioning
- **No idle costs**: Pay only for actual usage
- **High availability**: Dual backend redundancy
- **Model flexibility**: Access to multiple models without deployment

### Negative
- **Slightly higher latency**: Serverless adds 100-500ms overhead
- **Token limits**: Serverless has context window restrictions
- **Complexity**: Requires intelligent routing logic
- **Monitoring**: Need comprehensive usage tracking

### Neutral
- **Migration effort**: 4-week implementation timeline
- **Training**: Team needs to understand hybrid model
- **Documentation**: Requires comprehensive guides

## Implementation
1. **Phase 0**: Foundation - SQLite usage tracking, cost monitoring
2. **Phase 1**: MCP Server - Natural language infrastructure control
3. **Phase 2**: Chat Integration - Seamless unified chat experience
4. **Phase 3**: Infrastructure as Code - Pulumi-managed deployment
5. **Phase 4**: Documentation - User guides and migration playbooks

## Metrics
- Cost per request
- P50/P95/P99 latency
- Backend distribution (serverless vs GPU)
- Error rates by backend
- User satisfaction scores
