# Sophia AI Memory & Learnings

This document captures key learnings, decisions, and patterns discovered during Sophia AI development.

## Architecture Decisions

### 2024-01-XX: Chose LangGraph over AutoGen
- **Context**: Needed production-ready orchestration framework
- **Decision**: LangGraph for its DAG-based architecture
- **Rationale**: Better state management, clearer execution flow
- **Result**: More reliable agent coordination

### 2024-01-XX: Mem0 for Memory System
- **Context**: Evaluating memory solutions
- **Decision**: Mem0 over OpenAI's memory
- **Rationale**: 26% better accuracy, 91% lower latency
- **Result**: Better context retention across conversations

## Technical Learnings

### Citation System Implementation
- **Learning**: Users trust numbered citations ([1], [2]) more than inline links
- **Pattern**: Extract sources during LLM generation, not after
- **Gotcha**: Must verify sources exist before displaying

### Cortex Model Routing
- **Learning**: Model size doesn't always correlate with quality
- **Pattern**: Use smallest model that meets accuracy requirements
- **Cost Savings**: 60-80% reduction by smart routing

### Memory Extraction
- **Learning**: Two-phase pipeline (extract then update) prevents conflicts
- **Pattern**: Background summary refresh keeps inference fast
- **Gotcha**: Must handle contradictory information gracefully

## UI/UX Insights

### Blank Canvas Problem
- **Issue**: Users don't know what to ask
- **Solution**: Ice breaker prompts + templates
- **Result**: 3x increase in initial engagement

### Citation Display
- **Tested**: Inline links vs numbered references vs footnotes
- **Winner**: Numbered references with collapsible sidebar
- **Reason**: Cleaner reading experience, optional detail

### Focus Modes
- **Learning**: Context switching is cognitive overhead
- **Solution**: Dedicated modes (Business, Code, Data)
- **Result**: More relevant responses, happier users

## Performance Optimizations

### Response Time Improvements
1. **Parallel agent execution**: -40% latency
2. **Redis caching**: -30% for repeated queries
3. **Connection pooling**: -20% database overhead
4. **Async everywhere**: -25% overall

### Memory Optimization
- **Vector chunk size**: 512 tokens optimal
- **Overlap**: 50 tokens prevents context loss
- **Embedding model**: Arctic Embed best for our data

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall: Over-engineering the first version
- **Solution**: Start with citations, add features gradually
- **Learning**: CEO wants reliability over features

### Pitfall: Ignoring cost implications
- **Solution**: Track every LLM call, optimize routing
- **Learning**: Costs add up quickly at scale

### Pitfall: Memory conflicts
- **Solution**: Version control for memories
- **Learning**: Recent memories should override old ones

## Integration Patterns

### Snowflake Cortex
```python
# Pattern: Always specify temperature
result = cortex.complete(
    model="llama3-70b",
    prompt=prompt,
    temperature=0.2  # Deterministic for facts
)
```

### Mem0 Storage
```python
# Pattern: Tag memories for easy retrieval
memory.add(
    content=conversation,
    tags=["decision", "revenue", "q4-2024"],
    metadata={"importance": "high"}
)
```

## Security Considerations

### Prompt Injection Prevention
- **Pattern**: Validate input length and characters
- **Learning**: Regex filters catch 90% of attempts
- **Fallback**: Human review for suspicious patterns

### Data Isolation
- **Pattern**: User ID in every query
- **Learning**: Row-level security in Snowflake
- **Critical**: Never mix user contexts

## Debugging Techniques

### LLM Response Issues
1. Check temperature settings
2. Verify model selection
3. Review prompt construction
4. Examine token limits

### Memory Retrieval Problems
1. Check embedding similarity threshold
2. Verify vector index health
3. Review tag filtering
4. Examine time-based decay

## Future Considerations

### MCP Integration
- **Status**: Planning for Week 5-6
- **Purpose**: Standardized agent communication
- **Risk**: Still emerging standard

### Multi-Agent Scaling
- **Current**: 3 specialized agents
- **Future**: Domain-specific agents per department
- **Challenge**: Coordination complexity

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- Citation accuracy: Currently 87%, target 95%
- Memory recall: Currently 89%, target 95%
- Response time: Currently 280ms, target 200ms
- User satisfaction: Currently 8.2/10, target 9/10

### Cost Tracking
- Average cost per query: $0.0023
- Daily budget: $50 (CEO usage only)
- Optimization potential: 40% via better routing

## Team Notes

### Development Workflow
- **Best Practice**: Test citations manually before automation
- **Tool**: Cursor AI for code generation works well
- **Process**: Always update this doc with learnings

### Communication
- **CEO Feedback**: Weekly demos essential
- **Documentation**: Keep it practical, not academic
- **Decisions**: Document why, not just what
