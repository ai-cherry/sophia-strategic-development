# Automated Deployment Recovery System

## Overview

The Sophia AI platform includes a comprehensive automated deployment recovery system designed to handle common deployment issues without manual intervention. This system addresses the recurring problems we've experienced with frontend package corruption, backend dependency issues, and service startup failures.

## Problem Statement

### Common Deployment Issues
1. **Frontend Package Corruption**: `Invalid package config` errors in `node_modules/ms/package.json`
2. **Backend Missing Dependencies**: `ModuleNotFoundError` for critical packages (sqlalchemy, jwt, passlib)
3. **Service Startup Failures**: Port conflicts, import errors, configuration issues
4. **Environment Inconsistencies**: Different behavior across local, staging, and production

### Root Causes
- Incomplete npm installations during CI/CD
- Node.js version conflicts between environments
- Package cache corruption on build servers
- Race conditions during parallel installs
- Missing Python dependencies after environment changes

## Automated Solutions

### 1. Quick Deployment Fix Script (`scripts/quick_deployment_fix.sh`)

**Use Case**: Immediate local deployment recovery

```bash
# Run from project root
bash scripts/quick_deployment_fix.sh
```

**What it does**:
- Kills existing processes (uvicorn, npm, vite)
- Installs missing Python dependencies
- Clears npm cache completely
- Removes and reinstalls node_modules
- Fixes package vulnerabilities
- Starts all services with health checks
- Provides detailed status report

**Output**:
```

```

### 2. Comprehensive Recovery Script (`scripts/automated_deployment_recovery.py`)

**Use Case**: Advanced recovery with retries, monitoring, and reporting

```bash
# Full recovery
python scripts/automated_deployment_recovery.py

# Status check only
python scripts/automated_deployment_recovery.py --status-only
```

**Features**:
- **Multi-phase Recovery**: Frontend → Backend → MCP servers
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts with 30-second delays
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time endpoint checking
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: JSON reports with recommendations
- **Service Management**: Automatic process management
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging

**Success Criteria**: ≥66% services healthy (at least 2/3 services operational)

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration (`.github/workflows/automated-deployment-recovery.yml`)

**Triggers**:
- **Manual**: Via GitHub Actions UI with recovery type selection
- **Automatic**: When deployment workflows fail

**Recovery Types**:
- `full`: Complete frontend + backend + MCP recovery
- `frontend-only`: Only frontend package fixes
- `backend-only`: Only Python dependency fixes
- `status-check`: Health monitoring only

**Features**:
- **Automatic Issue Creation**: Creates GitHub issues on recovery failure
- **Slack Notifications**: Real-time status updates
- **Artifact Collection**: Saves logs and reports
- **Health Monitoring**: Extended production service checks

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Each Tool

| Scenario | Tool | Command |
|----------|------|---------|
| Local development issues | Quick Fix Script | `bash scripts/quick_deployment_fix.sh` |
| Production deployment failure | GitHub Actions | Manual trigger from Actions tab |
| Automated recovery after CI/CD failure | GitHub Actions | Automatic trigger |
| Debugging service health | Comprehensive Script | `python scripts/automated_deployment_recovery.py --status-only` |
| Complex multi-service issues | Comprehensive Script | `python scripts/automated_deployment_recovery.py` |

### Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# Example integration in deployment workflow
- name: Deploy Services
  run: |
    # Your deployment commands
    
- name: Trigger Recovery on Failure
  if: failure()
  uses: ./.github/workflows/automated-deployment-recovery.yml
  with:
    recovery_type: 'full'
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Preventive Measures

**Package.json Management**:
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0",
    "npm": ">=9.0.0"
  },
  "packageManager": "npm@9.8.1"
}
```

**Docker Multi-stage Builds**:
```dockerfile
# Clear build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Runtime stage
FROM node:18-alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
```

### 2. Monitoring Integration

**Health Check Endpoints**:
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
        "services": {
            "database": await check_database(),
            "cache": await check_redis(),
            "mcp": await check_mcp_servers()
        }
    }
```

**Prometheus Metrics**:
```python
deployment_recovery_counter = Counter(
    'deployment_recovery_total',
    'Number of deployment recoveries',
    ['recovery_type', 'success']
)
```

### 3. Environment Consistency

**Docker Compose Override**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
      - /app/node_modules  # Prevent host node_modules interference
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Invalid package config" Error
**Cause**: Corrupted package.json in node_modules
**Solution**: Complete node_modules rebuild
```bash
rm -rf frontend/node_modules frontend/package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install --no-package-lock
```

#### 2. "ModuleNotFoundError" for Python packages
**Cause**: Missing dependencies after environment changes
**Solution**: Reinstall required packages
```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pyjwt passlib[bcrypt] aiofiles python-multipart
```

#### 3. Port Already in Use
**Cause**: Previous processes not properly terminated
**Solution**: Kill existing processes
```bash
pkill -f "uvicorn|npm|vite"
sleep 3
# Then restart services
```

#### 4. Health Checks Failing
**Cause**: Services not fully started or configuration issues
**Solution**: Extended waiting with retries
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
    if curl -s http://localhost:8000/health; then
        echo "Service ready"
        break
    fi
    sleep 5
done
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- **Recovery Success Rate**: >95% target
- **Time to Recovery**: <5 minutes target
- **Service Availability**: >99.9% target
- **Mean Time Between Failures**: >7 days target

### Alert Thresholds
- 2+ recovery failures in 24 hours → Critical alert
- Recovery time >10 minutes → Warning alert
- Any service down >15 minutes → Critical alert

### Dashboards
- **Real-time Health**: Service status, response times, error rates
- **Recovery Analytics**: Success rates, failure patterns, timing trends
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage during recovery

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Predictive Recovery**: AI-based failure prediction
2. **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime recovery
3. **Canary Analysis**: Gradual rollout with automatic rollback
4. **Cross-Environment Sync**: Consistent recovery across environments
