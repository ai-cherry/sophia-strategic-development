# Performance Playbook

This playbook provides best practices, troubleshooting, and tuning guidance for maintaining ultra-fast, high-concurrency agent performance in Sophia AI. Designed for both AI and human developers.

---

## 🚀 Using AgnoPerformanceOptimizer
- **All major agents are pooled and tracked by AgnoPerformanceOptimizer.**
- **Instantiation:** Use `await AgentClass.pooled(config)` for all agent creation.
- **Pool size:** Default is 10 per agent type; can be increased for high-concurrency workloads.
- **Metrics:** All instantiation times, pool sizes, and memory usage are tracked automatically.

---

## 📊 Reading & Interpreting Live Metrics
- **API:** `/api/metrics/agno-performance` returns real-time metrics for all agent types.
- **CEO Dashboard:** `/ceo-dashboard` visualizes key metrics (instantiation time, pool size, memory, agent types).
- **Key Metrics:**
  - `avg_instantiation_us`: Average agent instantiation time (target: <10μs)
  - `pool_size`: Number of pooled agents available
  - `pool_max`: Maximum pool size
  - `instantiation_samples`: Number of instantiation events tracked
  - `memory_per_agent_kib`: (If available) memory usage per agent

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
### **Slow Agent Instantiation**
- **Check:** Is `pooled` instantiation being used everywhere?
- **Check:** Is the pool size too small for your workload?
- **Action:** Increase pool size in `agno_performance_optimizer.py` if needed.
- **Check:** Are there blocking operations in agent constructors?

### **Pool Exhaustion**
- **Symptoms:** New agent instantiation is slow, or errors about pool exhaustion.
- **Action:**
  - Increase pool size.
  - Release agents back to the pool after use (if using manual pooling).
  - Monitor pool usage via metrics API.

### **Performance Regression**
- **Checklist:**
  - Are all agents using the latest pooled pattern?
  - Are any agents doing heavy work in `__init__`?
  - Are there new blocking I/O or synchronous calls?
  - Are feature flags or new features impacting performance?
  - Check `/api/metrics/agno-performance` for spikes in instantiation time or pool exhaustion.

---

## 🏗️ Tuning & Best Practices
- **Keep agent constructors (`__init__`) lightweight.**
- **Use async I/O for all network/database operations.**
- **Monitor live metrics after any deployment or major change.**
- **Document any custom pooling or performance logic in the agent/service reference.**
- **For high-throughput workloads, pre-warm agent pools on startup.**
- **Use feature flags to safely roll out performance-impacting changes.**

## 📝 Performance Regression Checklist
- [ ] All agents use `pooled` instantiation
- [ ] Pool size is appropriate for expected concurrency
- [ ] No blocking I/O in agent constructors
- [ ] Live metrics show <10μs instantiation time
- [ ] No pool exhaustion or memory spikes
- [ ] CEO dashboard and metrics API are monitored after changes

## AI-Parseable Section
- All metrics, tuning parameters, and troubleshooting steps are documented in a consistent, parseable format for AI coding agents.
- Example queries and responses are included in the metrics API and dashboard.
