4. **Restart VSCode Terminal**:
   - Close all terminal instances
   - Open a new terminal with `CMD + J` or View â†’ Terminal

## Alternative Method (Settings JSON)

You can also add this to your VSCode settings:

```json

## Verifying Shell Integration

After setting zsh:
1. Restart VSCode completely
2. Open a new terminal
3. The shell integration should now work with Cline

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
- Make sure VSCode is fully updated
- Check that zsh is installed: `which zsh`
- Ensure shell integration is enabled in settings
