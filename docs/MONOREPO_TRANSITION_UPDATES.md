# Monorepo Transition Documentation Updates

## Summary of Changes

To ensure AI coders are not confused about the project structure during the monorepo transition, the following documentation has been updated:

### 1. Created Transition Guide
- **File**: `docs/monorepo/MONOREPO_TRANSITION_GUIDE.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive guide explaining the dual structure during transition
- **Content**: Current vs future structure, migration status, timeline, and clear instructions

### 2. Updated .cursorrules
- **Changes**:
  - Added prominent warning at the very beginning about monorepo transition
  - Updated File Organization section to show both current (USE THIS) and future (DO NOT USE YET) structures
  - Updated Agent Development Pattern to show current and future import patterns
  - Added reference to transition guide

### 3. Updated System Handbook
- **File**: `docs/system_handbook/00_SOPHIA_AI_SYSTEM_HANDBOOK.md`
- **Changes**: Added Phase 7 for Monorepo Transformation with timeline and note about current structure

### 4. Updated README.md
- **Changes**:
  - Added Monorepo Transition Notice section near the top
  - Removed duplicate content at the end
  - Added link to transition guide

### 5. Updated DEVELOPMENT.md
- **Changes**: Added Monorepo Transition Notice at the beginning with clear instructions

## Key Messages for AI Coders

1. **USE the old structure** (`backend/`, `frontend/`) for all new code
2. **DO NOT USE the new structure** (`apps/`, `libs/`) until migration is complete
3. **CHECK migration status** in the transition guide before making changes
4. **FOLLOW existing patterns** in the current codebase

## Timeline

- **Current Phase**: Planning & Design (January 2025)
- **Migration Start**: February 2025
- **Target Completion**: April 2025

## Why This Matters

During the transition period, having two directory structures could be very confusing for AI coders. These updates ensure:
- Clear guidance on which structure to use
- No duplicate code creation
- Consistent development patterns
- Smooth transition when migration happens
