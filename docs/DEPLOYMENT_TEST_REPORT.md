                        └──────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Intelligent Routing**
```
Request → Capability Router → Health Check → Primary Server
                                    ↓
                              Fallback Servers
```

### 3. **Caching Layer**
```
CEO Query → GPTCache → Redis → Semantic Match → Fast Response
                         ↓
                    Pre-warmed Queries
```

## Installation Requirements

To achieve 100% functionality, install:

```bash
pip install snowflake-connector-python sentence-transformers
```
