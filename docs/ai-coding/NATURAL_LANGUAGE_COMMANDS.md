# üí¨ **Natural Language Commands Reference**

> **Complete guide to conversing with Sophia AI's MCP servers using natural language.** No more memorizing syntax - just describe what you want!

## **üéØ Command Patterns**

### **Basic Pattern**
```
@[server] [action] [target] [options]
```

### **Examples**
```bash
@sophia generate a user authentication system
@codacy analyze this file for security issues  
@memory remember we use PostgreSQL for main database

**Note:** All UI generation requests go through the unified chat interface. Simply type your request naturally without any @ prefix:
```bash
"Create a dashboard component with glassmorphism"
"Build a responsive navigation bar"
"Generate a data table with sorting"
```

## **üí° Pro Tips**

### **Be Specific**

# ‚úÖ Specific
@sophia create an async Python function that fetches user data from PostgreSQL, 
caches it in Redis for 5 minutes, and includes error handling
```

### **Provide Context**
```bash
# ‚ùå No context
@sophia fix this error

# ‚úÖ With context
@sophia fix this error in our FastAPI application: 
"RuntimeError: Event loop is closed" when running async tests
```

### **Chain Commands**
```bash
# Generate ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Improve
@sophia create user authentication endpoint &&
@codacy analyze security &&
@sophia apply security best practices
```

### **Use Memory Effectively**
```bash
# Before making decisions
@memory what authentication method did we use in other services?

# After implementing
@memory remember: Implemented OAuth2 with JWT for user service
```

## **üé® Advanced Patterns**

### **Conditional Commands**
```bash
@sophia if this is a public API, add rate limiting

@codacy only fix critical security issues

@memory search for similar issues in the last month
```

### **Batch Operations**
