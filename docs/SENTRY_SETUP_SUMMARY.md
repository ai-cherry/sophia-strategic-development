   - Docker configuration ready for deployment
   - Supports all major Sentry operations

2. **Sentry Agent** (`backend/agents/specialized/sentry_agent.py`)
   - Already configured to work with the MCP server
   - Supports fetching issue context and triggering fixes

3. **Webhook Handler** (`backend/api/webhooks/sentry_webhook.py`)
   - Processes real-time Sentry events

   vim scripts/test/test_sentry_agent.py
   # Change: ISSUE_ID = "your_actual_issue_id_here"
   
   # Run the test
   python scripts/test/test_sentry_agent.py
   ```python

3. **Deploy the MCP server**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.sentry.yml up -d
   ```python
