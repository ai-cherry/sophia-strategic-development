# Codebase Optimization Fixes Summary

## Date: June 21, 2025

### Overview
Successfully resolved all pre-commit hook failures for the optimized codebase files.

### Files Fixed

1. **backend/core/config_loader.py**
   - Added missing dependencies to pyproject.toml: `pyyaml` and `watchdog`
   - Added type ignore comment for yaml import: `import yaml  # type: ignore[import-untyped]`
   - Added noqa comment for Pydantic validator: `def validate_percentage(cls, v):  # noqa: N805`

2. **backend/integrations/base_integration.py**
   - No issues found - passed all checks

3. **backend/mcp/unified_mcp_servers.py**
   - No issues found - passed all checks

### Pre-commit Hooks Status
All hooks now passing:
- ✅ trim trailing whitespace
- ✅ fix end of files
- ✅ check yaml (skipped - no yaml files)
- ✅ check for added large files
- ✅ black (code formatting)
- ✅ isort (import sorting)
- ✅ ruff (linting)
- ✅ ruff-format (formatting)
- ✅ bandit (security)
- ✅ mypy (type checking)

### Dependencies Added
Added to `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
pyyaml = "^6.0.1"
watchdog = "^4.0.0"
```

### Type Annotations
- Used type ignore comment for yaml import to bypass mypy's missing stub warning
- Used noqa comment for Pydantic validator's cls parameter to bypass ruff's naming convention check

### Next Steps
1. Run `poetry install` to install the new dependencies
2. All files are now ready for commit
3. The codebase optimization changes can be safely merged

### Notes
- The yaml type stubs (types-PyYAML) were already installed in the virtual environment
- The fixes maintain code functionality while satisfying all linting and type checking requirements
