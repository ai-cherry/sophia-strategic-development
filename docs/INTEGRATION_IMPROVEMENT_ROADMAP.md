## Resource Requirements

### Team Allocation
- **2 Senior Developers**: Full-time on MCP migration
- **1 Senior Developer**: ETL decomposition lead
- **1 Developer**: Orchestration consolidation
- **1 DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure and deployment
- **1 Technical Writer**: Documentation updates

### Infrastructure
- Staging environment for testing
- MCP Inspector licenses
- Additional monitoring tools
- Backup systems

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **MCP Migration Breaking Changes**
   - Mitigation: Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Rollback: Git tags for each migration

2. **ETL Pipeline Performance**
   - Mitigation: Parallel running of old/new
   - Rollback: Keep monolithic version

3. **Orchestration Disruption**
   - Mitigation: Phased approach
   - Rollback: n8n workflow backups

### Business Risks
1. **Service Downtime**
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployments
   - Communication: Status page updates

2. **Data Loss**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backups
   - Validation: Checksums and row counts

## Success Metrics
