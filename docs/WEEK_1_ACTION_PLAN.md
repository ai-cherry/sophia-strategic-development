# Week 1: Immediate Actions - Foundation Sprint

## Overview

This week focuses on laying the groundwork for our performance-first architecture. Since the repository isn't active with real data, we can make bold architectural decisions.

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1 (Monday): Performance Baseline & Architecture

**Morning Tasks:**
1. Set up performance benchmarking tools
2. Measure current API latencies
3. Profile database query performance
4. Document all bottlenecks found

**Afternoon Tasks:**
1. Design target performance architecture
2. Create multi-tier caching strategy
3. Plan service decomposition
4. Define performance SLOs (p99 < 100ms)

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/architecture/CURRENT_BOTTLENECKS.md`
- `docs/architecture/TARGET_PERFORMANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `scripts/performance/baseline_performance.py`

### Day 2 (Tuesday): Monorepo Structure Design

**Morning Tasks:**
1. Map all service dependencies
2. Identify shared libraries to extract
3. Plan migration order (lowest risk first)
4. Design package boundaries

**Afternoon Tasks:**
1. Configure Turborepo settings
2. Set up remote caching strategy
3. Design CI/CD pipeline changes
4. Create rollback procedures

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/monorepo/SERVICE_DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `docs/monorepo/MIGRATION_ORDER.md`
- Updated `turbo.json` configuration

### Day 3 (Wednesday): Performance Tooling Setup

**Morning Tasks:**
1. Install load testing tools (K6, autocannon)
2. Create load testing scenarios
3. Set up performance profiling
4. Configure APM integration

**Afternoon Tasks:**
1. Build automated performance tests
2. Create performance regression detection
3. Set up continuous benchmarking
4. Document performance testing strategy

**Deliverables:**
- `tests/load/` directory with test scenarios
- `scripts/performance/profile_endpoints.py`
- Performance testing documentation

### Day 4 (Thursday): Caching Strategy Implementation

**Morning Tasks:**
1. Design cache key patterns
2. Implement multi-tier cache manager
3. Set up Redis cluster configuration
4. Plan cache warming strategies

**Afternoon Tasks:**
1. Create cache invalidation patterns
2. Implement cache metrics collection
3. Design fallback strategies
4. Document caching policies

**Deliverables:**
- `packages/cache/cache_manager.py`
- `docs/architecture/CACHING_STRATEGY.md`
- Redis configuration files

### Day 5 (Friday): Database Optimization Planning

**Morning Tasks:**
1. Analyze slow query logs
2. Identify missing indexes
3. Plan table partitioning strategy
4. Design connection pooling

**Afternoon Tasks:**
1. Create database optimization scripts
2. Plan materialized views
3. Design batch processing patterns
4. Document optimization strategy

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/database/OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`
- `packages/database/optimized_pool.py`
- SQL optimization scripts

## Key Decisions to Make This Week

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Confirm FastAPI for backend (with performance optimizations)
   - Choose between Next.js App Router vs Vite for frontend
   - Decide on Kafka vs RabbitMQ for event streaming
   - Select monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana vs Datadog)

2. **Architecture Patterns**
   - Microservices boundaries
   - Event sourcing implementation
   - CQRS for read/write separation
   - API Gateway pattern

3. **Performance Targets**
   - API latency: p99 < 100ms
   - Database queries: < 50ms average
   - Cache hit rate: > 90%
   - Throughput: 10K req/s

## Tools to Install

```bash
# Performance testing
npm install -g autocannon k6 clinic

# Python profiling
pip install py-spy memory-profiler line-profiler

# Database tools
pip install pgbench asyncpg[postgresql]

# Monitoring
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

## Success Criteria

By end of Week 1:
- [ ] Performance baseline established
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Monorepo migration plan approved
- [ ] Testing infrastructure operational
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented

## Communication Plan

- **Daily Standup**: 9 AM - Progress update
- **Architecture Review**: Wednesday 2 PM
- **Week 1 Retrospective**: Friday 4 PM

## Risk Mitigation

1. **If migration seems too complex**: Start with a single service
2. **If performance tools overwhelm**: Focus on K6 and basic profiling
3. **If decisions take too long**: Use spike solutions to validate

**Remember**: This week is about planning and tooling. We're setting up for success, not rushing into coding. Quality foundation = Quality system.
