## API Endpoints

### Chat Integration
```bash
POST /api/v3/chat
# Enhanced chat with temporal learning integration
# Returns: temporal_learning_applied, temporal_interaction_id
```

### Temporal Learning
```bash
POST /api/v1/temporal-learning/chat/correct
# Process user correction for temporal learning

POST /api/v1/temporal-learning/interactions/{id}/validate
# Validate a temporal learning interaction

GET /api/v1/temporal-learning/dashboard/data
# Get comprehensive learning dashboard data

GET /api/v1/temporal-learning/health
# Health check for temporal learning service
```

### System Status
```bash
GET /api/v3/system/status
# Enhanced system status including temporal learning
```

## User Workflow

### 1. Natural Conversation
```
User: "What tasks are due today?"
AI: "Based on today's date (January 8, 2025), here are your tasks..."
```

### 2. User Correction
```
User: "Actually, today is January 9, 2025"
AI: "Thank you for the correction. I've updated my understanding."
```

### 3. Learning Application
- System stores the correction
- Updates temporal knowledge base
- Applies learning to future interactions
- Provides feedback to user

### 4. Dashboard Monitoring
- View learning interactions
- Monitor system accuracy
- Process correction suggestions
- Track learning progress

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **User Query** → Chat Service → Temporal Learning Service
2. **Temporal Processing** → Context Analysis → Response Generation
3. **User Correction** → Correction Processing → Knowledge Update
4. **Learning Application** → Future Query Enhancement

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when temporal learning unavailable
- Fallback to standard chat processing
- Error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance Considerations
- Non-blocking temporal learning processing
