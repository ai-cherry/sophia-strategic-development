model, metadata = await server.route_to_model(
    task="analyze complex business requirements",
    context_size=150000  # Automatically routes to Gemini
)
```

### 2. WebFetch Usage
```python
# Fetch and process web content
result = await server.webfetch(
    url="https://docs.cline.bot/v3.18/features",
    use_cache=True
)
# Access markdown-formatted content
content = result.markdown_content
```

### 3. Self-Knowledge Integration
```python
# Discover server capabilities
capabilities = await server.get_capabilities_endpoint()
features = await server.get_features_endpoint()
```

### 4. Improved Diff Strategies
```python
# Automatic fallback through strategies
result = await server.improved_diff_edit(
    file_path="backend/service.py",
    search_content="old_implementation",
    replace_content="new_implementation",
    strategy="auto"  # Tries exact, fuzzy, then context-aware
)
```

## Natural Language Commands

### WebFetch Commands
- "Fetch the latest Cline documentation"
- "Get competitive intelligence from [competitor website]"
- "Retrieve and summarize API documentation from [url]"

### Model Routing Commands
