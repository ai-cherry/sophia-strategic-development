```yaml
# Gong Connector Configuration
source:
  name: "Pay Ready Gong Source"
  type: "gong"
  config:
    access_key: "TV33BPZ5UN45QKZCZ2UCAKRXHQ6Q3L5N"
    access_key_secret: "[JWT_TOKEN]"
    start_date: "2025-03-17T00:00:00Z"  # 90 days back

destination:
  name: "Sophia Unified Database"
  type: "postgres"
  config:
    host: "170.9.9.253"
    database: "sophia_unified_db"
    schema: "public"
    ssl_mode: "prefer"

connection:
  sync_mode: "incremental"
  schedule: "0 * * * *"  # Hourly
  streams:
    - calls: "append_dedup"
    - users: "overwrite"
```

**Data Transformation Pipeline:**
```sql
-- dbt model for Gong call normalization
{{ config(materialized='incremental') }}

SELECT
    id as gong_call_id,
    started as interaction_date,
    duration as interaction_duration_seconds,
    primaryParticipant.emailAddress as email_address,
    'gong' as source_system,
    'call' as interaction_type,
    CASE
        WHEN sentiment > 0.7 THEN 'positive'
        WHEN sentiment < 0.3 THEN 'negative'
        ELSE 'neutral'
    END as sentiment_category
FROM {{ source('gong', 'calls') }}
{% if is_incremental() %}
    WHERE started > (SELECT MAX(interaction_date) FROM {{ this }})
{% endif %}
```

### 🗄️ Database Performance Optimization

**Indexing Strategy:**
```sql
-- Critical indexes for 13,069+ calls
CREATE INDEX idx_unified_interactions_date_source
ON unified_interactions(interaction_date, source_system);

CREATE INDEX idx_unified_contacts_email_hash
ON unified_contacts USING HASH(email_address);

CREATE INDEX idx_transcript_search
ON call_transcript_segments USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', text_content));
```

**Materialized Views for Analytics:**
```sql
-- Pre-computed daily analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_interaction_analytics AS
SELECT
    DATE(interaction_date) as interaction_date,
    source_system,
    COUNT(*) as total_interactions,
    AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
    COUNT(DISTINCT contact_id) as unique_contacts
FROM unified_interactions
GROUP BY DATE(interaction_date), source_system;
```

### 🔍 Natural Language Processing

**Query Processing Pipeline:**
```python
async def process_natural_language_query(query: str):
    # 1. Intent classification and entity extraction
    intent = await classify_intent(query)
    entities = await extract_entities(query)

    # 2. Determine relevant data sources
    sources = determine_sources(intent, entities)

    # 3. Generate SQL queries for each source
    sql_queries = await generate_sql_queries(intent, entities, sources)

    # 4. Execute parallel queries
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        execute_query(query, source) for query, source in sql_queries
    ])

    # 5. Synthesize unified response
    return await synthesize_response(query, results, intent)
```
