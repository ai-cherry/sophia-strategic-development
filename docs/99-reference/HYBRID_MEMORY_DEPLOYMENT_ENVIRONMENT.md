# ðŸ”— Hybrid Memory Architecture + Development Environment Integration

## Overview

This document connects the newly implemented Hybrid Memory Architecture with the Sophia AI development environment standards.

## Environment Requirements for Memory Architecture

### 1. **Virtual Environment Consistency**
The hybrid memory architecture requires the standardized Python 3.11.6 environment described in your setup:

```bash
# Always start with:
source activate_sophia_env.sh

# This ensures:
- Correct Python version (3.11.6) for all memory services
- Proper package versions for Qdrant, Mem0, Redis clients
- Consistent environment across Cursor, Cline, and other AI tools
```

### 2. **Memory Service Dependencies**
The virtual environment must include these packages for the memory architecture:

```bash
# Core memory packages (automatically installed by activate_sophia_env.sh)
pip install qdrant-client==1.9.1
pip install mem0ai==0.0.20
pip install redis==5.0.4
pip install asyncpg==0.29.0
pip install pgvector==0.2.5
pip install torch==2.2.0  # For GPU cache
pip install cupy-cuda12x==13.0.0  # For GPU operations
```

### 3. **FastAPI Integration**
The memory services integrate with your aligned FastAPI applications:

- **Working App (8000)**: Main API with full memory integration
- **Simple App (8001)**: Lightweight memory queries
- **Minimal App (8002)**: Basic memory health checks
- **Distributed App (8003)**: Distributed memory operations

### 4. **Devcontainer Enhancement**
For the memory architecture, the devcontainer.json provides additional benefits:

```json
{
  "name": "Sophia AI Memory Development",
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
    "args": {
      "INSTALL_CUDA": "true",  // For GPU memory operations
      "PYTHON_VERSION": "3.11.6"
    }
  },
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/nvidia-cuda:1": {}
  },
