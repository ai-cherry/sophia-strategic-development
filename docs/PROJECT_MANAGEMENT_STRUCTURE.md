#### 2. **Sales Team → Slack**  
- **Purpose**: Sales process management, deal tracking, customer communication
- **Key Data**: Deal pipelines, customer interactions, sales activities, team coordination
- **Integration**: Sales performance tracking, deal risk assessment, revenue forecasting

#### 3. **CEO/Executive → Notion**
- **Purpose**: Strategic planning, executive decision making, high-level coordination
- **Key Data**: Strategic initiatives, board materials, executive reports, business planning
- **Integration**: Strategic OKR tracking, executive dashboard, business intelligence

#### 4. **Engineering Team → Linear**

- **Key Data**: Development tasks, technical debt, bug reports, sprint planning
- **Integration**: Development velocity, code quality metrics, technical risk assessment

## Unified Data Architecture

### Snowflake Schema Design
```sql
-- Unified project management schema
CREATE SCHEMA PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED;

-- Department-specific staging tables
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.STG_ASANA_PROJECTS;     -- Product team data
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.STG_SLACK_PROJECTS;     -- Sales team coordination
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.STG_NOTION_PROJECTS;    -- Executive planning
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.STG_LINEAR_PROJECTS;    -- Engineering projects

-- Unified analytics tables
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.UNIFIED_PROJECT_HEALTH;
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.CROSS_DEPARTMENT_PRIORITIES;
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.OKR_KPI_TRACKING;
CREATE TABLE PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_UNIFIED.BLOCKED_PROJECT_ANALYSIS;
```

### MCP Server Integration
- **Asana MCP Server**: Product team data ingestion and analysis
- **Slack MCP Server**: Sales coordination and communication tracking  
- **Notion MCP Server**: Executive planning and strategic initiative management
- **Linear MCP Server**: Engineering project tracking and development metrics

## Unified Dashboard Purpose

### Primary Objectives
1. **Overall Prioritization**: Cross-department project impact scoring
2. **OKR/KPI Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of business objectives
3. **Stuck/Blocked Project Detection**: Automated identification of project risks
4. **Unified Executive View**: Single dashboard for all department activities

### Key Metrics
- **Cross-Department Impact Score**: Projects affecting multiple departments
- **Velocity Metrics**: Progress rates across all teams
- **Risk Assessment**: Blocked projects, resource conflicts, timeline risks
- **Resource Allocation**: Workload distribution across departments

### Natural Language Queries
- "What product features are blocked by engineering issues?"
- "Which sales deals need product team input?"
- "What executive decisions are waiting on development completion?"
- "Show me all high-priority projects across departments"

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Asana (Product) → MCP → Snowflake → Unified Analytics
Slack (Sales) → MCP → Snowflake → Unified Analytics  
Notion (CEO) → MCP → Snowflake → Unified Analytics
Linear (Engineering) → MCP → Snowflake → Unified Analytics
                                ↓
                    Unified Dashboard & AI Analysis
```

### AI-Powered Insights
- **Cross-Department Dependencies**: Identify projects requiring multi-team coordination
- **Priority Conflicts**: Detect competing priorities across departments
- **Resource Bottlenecks**: Identify teams/individuals with conflicting assignments
- **Timeline Optimization**: Suggest optimal project sequencing across departments

This structure enables comprehensive business intelligence while respecting each department's preferred project management workflow.
