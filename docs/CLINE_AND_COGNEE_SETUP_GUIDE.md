**Date:** December 20, 2024
**Status:** Generic Guide for Integrating Local VSCode with AI Platform

## 1. The Goal: A Seamless Human-AI Development Experience

This guide unlocks a powerful development workflow for AI-assisted coding. By following these steps, you will configure **Cline**, the in-editor AI command line, to communicate with:

1.  **A local `cognee` instance:** An MCP server that transforms your local codebase into a queryable knowledge graph.
2.  **Remote MCP servers:** A full suite of production tools (Pulumi, Kubernetes, GitHub, etc.) running in your infrastructure.

This creates a unified environment where you can ask deep, contextual questions about your local code and command remote infrastructure, all without leaving your editor.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

-   You have **VSCode** installed.
-   You have `git` and `uv` (a Python package installer) installed. `pip install uv`.
-   You have a Python project with virtual environment (`.venv`) set up.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Configuration

### Step 3.1: Install Cline for VSCode

1.  Open VSCode.
2.  Go to the Extensions Marketplace.
3.  Search for and install **"Cline (pre-release)"**.
4.  Reload VSCode when prompted. You should now see a "Cline" icon in your activity bar.

### Step 3.2: Set Up the `cognee` Knowledge Graph Engine

`cognee` is the magic that understands your codebase. We will clone it and set it up locally.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://www.github.com/topoteretes/cognee
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd cognee/cognee-mcp
    uv sync --reinstall
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *(Leave this terminal window open and activated for later)*

### Step 3.3: Configure Cline to Find Your MCP Servers

This is the most critical step. We need to tell Cline where to find both the local `cognee` server and your remote servers.

1.  **Find Your Cline Settings File:**
    -   In VSCode, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows).
    -   Type `> Cline: Open MCP Settings` and press Enter.
    -   This will open your `cline_mcp_settings.json` file.

2.  **Add the Server Configurations:**
    -   Paste the following JSON into the file.
    -   **Replace `{CLONE_PATH_TO_COGNEE}`** with the absolute path to the `cognee` directory you cloned.
    -   **Replace remote URLs** with your actual MCP server endpoints.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "cognee": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
            "--directory",
            "{CLONE_PATH_TO_COGNEE}/cognee-mcp",
            "run",
            "cognee"
          ],
          "env": {
            "ENV": "local",
            "TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM": "false",
            "LLM_API_KEY": "${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
          }
        },
        "ai_memory": {
          "url": "http://localhost:9000",
          "description": "Local AI Memory MCP server for persistent development context."
        },
        "codacy": {
          "url": "http://localhost:3008", 
          "description": "Local Codacy MCP server for code quality analysis."
        },
        "pulumi_remote": {
          "url": "http://your-pulumi-server:9000",
          "description": "Interface to your Pulumi deployment server."
        },
        "k8s_remote": {
          "url": "http://your-k8s-server:9000", 
          "description": "Interface to your Kubernetes cluster."
        },
        "github_remote": {
          "url": "http://your-github-server:9000",
          "description": "Interface to your GitHub project management server."
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:** The `LLM_API_KEY` for `cognee` uses `${env:OPENAI_API_KEY}`. To make this work, launch VSCode from a terminal with environment variables loaded:

    ```bash
    # From your project root directory
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # Load your environment variables (if using .env file)
    export $(cat .env | xargs) 2>/dev/null || true
    code .
    ```

4.  **Restart Cline:** Open the Command Palette again (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and run `> Cline: Restart`.

### Step 3.4: Build Your Code's Knowledge Graph

Now, you will instruct `cognee` to analyze your codebase and build its knowledge graph.

1.  **Open Cline:** Click the Cline icon in the VSCode activity bar.
2.  **Run the `codify` command:** In the Cline input, type the following command, replacing `{PROJECT_PATH}` with the absolute path to your project's backend/source directory:

    ```
    @cognee /codify --path {PROJECT_PATH}/backend
    ```

3.  **Wait for Processing:** You will see logs from the `cognee` server in the VSCode terminal. This process can take several minutes as it reads all files, generates embeddings, and builds the relational graph.

## 4. The Conversational Workflow: You Are Now an AI-Powered Developer

You are now fully set up. Here is how you can use this system:

**Example 1: Understand Local Code**

> `@cognee What is the purpose of the 'MCPOrchestrator' class and how does it relate to the 'mcp_client'?`

`cognee` will use its knowledge graph to provide a detailed, accurate answer about the relationships and functionality within your local code.

**Example 2: Store Development Context**

> `@ai_memory store this conversation about implementing async patterns`

The AI Memory MCP server will store important development decisions for future reference.

**Example 3: Code Quality Analysis**

> `@codacy analyze this Python function for potential issues`

The Codacy MCP server will provide real-time code quality feedback and suggestions.

**Example 4: Interact with Remote Infrastructure**

> `@pulumi_remote Preview the 'production' stack for the current project.`

Cline will securely route this request to your deployed Pulumi MCP server.

**Example 5: A Multi-Modal Workflow**

> `@cognee Show me the code for the 'AgentDeployment' component. Then, @k8s_remote tell me how many replicas of that agent are currently running.`

This demonstrates the true power of the system: seamless conversation that pivots between local code understanding and live infrastructure management.

## Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Issues
- Ensure you're in the correct virtual environment when launching VSCode
- Check that all required packages are installed in your `.venv`
- Use the generic activation script: `source activate_env.sh`

### Cline Configuration Issues
- Verify all paths in `cline_mcp_settings.json` are absolute and correct
- Check that MCP servers are running on specified ports
- Restart Cline after configuration changes

### MCP Server Connection Issues
- Verify server URLs and ports are accessible
- Check firewall and network settings for remote servers
- Ensure authentication credentials are properly configured

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have bridged your local development environment with powerful AI assistance tools. This unified, conversational interface dramatically enhances productivity, simplifies complex tasks, and represents the future of AI-assisted software development.

The configuration is now generic and can be adapted to any project by simply updating paths and server URLs to match your specific setup.
