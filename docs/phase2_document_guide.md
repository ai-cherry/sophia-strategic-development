## How to Use These Documents

1. **Executive Stakeholders**: Start with the Phase 2 Implementation Presentation for a high-level overview, then review the Phase 2 Implementation Plan for more details.

2. **Project Managers**: Review all documents, with particular focus on the Implementation Roadmap, Resource Requirements and Timeline, and Risk Assessment and Mitigation.

3. **Technical Teams**: Focus on the Scope and Objectives, Implementation Roadmap, and specific sections relevant to their domain (LangGraph, Cost Engineering, or Snowflake Cortex).

4. **QA and Testing Teams**: Review the Implementation Roadmap and Risk Assessment, with particular attention to testing strategies and quality assurance approaches.

5. **Operations Teams**: Focus on the Resource Requirements and Timeline, particularly infrastructure requirements and deployment planning.

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the Phase 2 implementation plan
2. Secure necessary resources and budget
3. Establish the project team and kick off the implementation
4. Begin with the Design and Architecture phase
5. Implement regular progress tracking and risk monitoring

## Document Maintenance

These documents should be treated as living documents that may be updated as the implementation progresses. Any significant changes to scope, timeline, or approach should be reflected in updates to these documents, with appropriate version control and stakeholder communication.
