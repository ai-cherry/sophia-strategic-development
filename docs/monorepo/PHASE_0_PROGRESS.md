- [x] Integrated security scanning (pip-audit, safety, npm audit)

### 4. Migration Tools
- [x] Created service migration script (`scripts/monorepo/migrate-service.sh`)
- [x] Created GitHub project setup script (`scripts/monorepo/setup-github-project.sh`)
- [x] Established migration mapping documentation

## Current State

â””â”€â”€ turbo.json          # Turborepo pipeline config
```

### Tools Installed
- âœ… UV (already in place for Python)
- âœ… PNPM (8.14.0 installed)
- âœ… Turborepo (1.13.4 installed)
- âœ… Git hooks for security

### Performance Baselines Documented
- Current build time: 15-20 minutes
- Current CI time: 20-25 minutes
- Current test time: 10 minutes per service
- Target: <5 minute builds with caching

## Next Steps (Phase 1 - Planning & Design)

### Immediate Actions
1. Run GitHub project setup script to create issues and milestones
2. Form cross-functional task force
3. Schedule kickoff meeting
4. Begin requirements gathering

### Week 1 Priorities
1. Complete detailed architecture design
2. Create service migration priority list
3. Define naming conventions and standards
4. Plan shared library extraction

### First Migration Candidate
Recommend starting with `backend/core` â†’ `libs/core` as it:
- Is a shared dependency
- Has clear boundaries
- Will validate the migration process
- Provides immediate value

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Dependency conflicts | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | UV already managing Python deps successfully |
| CI/CD disruption | ðŸŸ¢ Low | Templates ready, can run parallel |
| Learning curve | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | Scripts and docs created |
| Build performance | ðŸŸ¢ Low | Turborepo caching will help |

## Success Metrics Progress

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Build time | 15-20 min | <5 min | ðŸ”´ Not started |
| CI/CD duplication | 15+ files | 5-10 files | ðŸŸ¡ Templates ready |
| Developer onboarding | 2-3 days | <2 hours | ðŸŸ¡ Scripts ready |
| Dependency conflicts | Weekly | Rare | ðŸŸ¡ Structure ready |

## Commands Available

```bash
# Bootstrap the workspace
./scripts/monorepo/bootstrap-workspace.sh

# Set up GitHub project
./scripts/monorepo/setup-github-project.sh

# Migrate a service
./scripts/monorepo/migrate-service.sh <source> <type>

# Run security audit
./scripts/audit-deps.sh

# Test Turborepo
pnpm turbo run echo --filter=api
```

## Summary

Phase 0 is effectively complete with all infrastructure, documentation, and tooling in place. The monorepo structure is initialized, CI/CD templates are ready, and migration tools are available. 

Ready to proceed with Phase 1 (Detailed Planning & Design) and begin actual service migrations.
