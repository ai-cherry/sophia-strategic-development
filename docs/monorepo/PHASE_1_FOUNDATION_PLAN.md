# Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture Plan

## Executive Summary

With the repository not yet active with real data, we have a unique opportunity to establish a world-class foundation prioritizing **performance**, **scalability**, and **stability**. This plan leverages the monorepo transition to implement architectural improvements that would be difficult with live data.

## Core Principles

1. **Performance First**: Every decision optimizes for speed
2. **Scalability by Design**: Built for 1000x growth from day one
3. **Stability Through Simplicity**: Fewer moving parts, better reliability
4. **Data Locality**: Minimize network hops and latency
5. **Observability Everywhere**: Can't improve what you can't measure

## Phase 1 Timeline: 8 Weeks (January-February 2025)

### Week 1-2: Planning & Architecture Deep Dive

#### 1.1 Performance Baseline & Profiling
```bash
# Tools to implement
- Pyroscope for continuous profiling
- K6 for load testing infrastructure
- Lighthouse CI for frontend performance
- Database query analyzers
```

**Deliverables:**
- Performance requirement specifications
- Current bottleneck analysis
- Target metrics definition (P50, P95, P99)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### 1.2 Scalability Architecture Design
```yaml
Key Decisions:
  - Event-driven architecture with Kafka/Pulsar
  - CQRS pattern for read/write separation
  - Multi-region database strategy
  - Edge caching with Cloudflare Workers
  - Horizontal scaling patterns
```

#### 1.3 Stability Framework
```python
# Implement patterns
- Circuit breakers everywhere
- Bulkhead isolation
- Graceful degradation
- Chaos engineering readiness
- Blue-green deployment capability
```

### Week 3-4: Core Infrastructure Implementation

#### 2.1 High-Performance Data Layer
```sql
-- Snowflake Optimization
- Clustering keys on hot paths
- Materialized views for common queries
- Result caching strategy
- Query optimization rules
- Automatic table optimization
```

```python
# Connection Pool Optimization
class SnowflakeConnectionPool:
    """
    - Persistent connections
    - Query multiplexing
    - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
    - Connection warming
    - Smart routing based on query patterns
    """
```

#### 2.2 Caching Architecture
```yaml
L1 Cache: In-memory (process-level)
  - Size: 1GB per instance
  - TTL: 60 seconds
  - Use: Hot data, session state

L2 Cache: Redis Cluster
  - Size: 100GB
  - TTL: 5 minutes
  - Use: Shared data, computed results

L3 Cache: Snowflake Result Cache
  - Size: Unlimited
  - TTL: 24 hours
  - Use: Expensive computations

L4 Cache: CDN Edge
  - Global distribution
  - Static assets + API responses
  - Intelligent purging
```

#### 2.3 Async Processing Infrastructure
```python
# High-throughput job processing
- Celery with Redis backend
- Priority queues
- Rate limiting
- Dead letter queues
- Distributed tracing
```

### Week 5-6: Monorepo Migration & Optimization

#### 3.1 Build System Optimization
```javascript
// Turborepo configuration
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"],
      "cache": true,
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  },
  "globalEnv": ["NODE_ENV", "ENVIRONMENT"],
  "globalDependencies": ["tsconfig.json"]
}
```

**Performance Targets:**
- Cold build: <3 minutes
- Incremental build: <30 seconds
- Test suite: <2 minutes
- Deploy pipeline: <5 minutes

#### 3.2 Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
```typescript
// Dynamic imports for all routes
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));
const Analytics = lazy(() => import('./Analytics'));

// Micro-frontend architecture
const MCPServers = lazy(() => import('@sophia/mcp-servers'));
```

#### 3.3 Dependency Optimization
```python
# UV workspace configuration
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["apps/*", "libs/*"]

[tool.uv]
compile-bytecode = true
link-mode = "hardlink"
```

### Week 7: Testing & Benchmarking

#### 4.1 Performance Testing Suite
```python
# Comprehensive benchmarks
tests/performance/
├── api_load_tests.py      # K6 scripts
├── db_query_benchmarks.py # Query performance
├── memory_profiling.py    # Memory usage
└── frontend_metrics.js    # Core Web Vitals
```

#### 4.2 Scalability Testing
```yaml
Scenarios:
  - 1K concurrent users
  - 10K requests/second
  - 1M records processing
  - 100GB data ingestion
```

#### 4.3 Chaos Engineering
