## Overview
Successfully applied docstring formatting fixes across the entire Sophia AI codebase using the `scripts/fix_all_docstrings.py` tool.

## Changes Applied
- **Files Fixed**: 2,081 out of 2,838 Python files processed
- **Fix Types**:
  1. Added missing periods to single-line docstrings
  2. Ensured proper blank lines after summary lines in multi-line docstrings

## Script Features
The docstring fixer script (`scripts/fix_all_docstrings.py`) includes:
- Safe regex-based pattern matching
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Support for both `"""` and `'''` style docstrings
- Preserves code structure and only modifies docstrings
- Can process individual files or entire directories

## Usage
```bash
# Example usage:
bash
```python

## Known Issues
Some files had pre-existing syntax errors in their docstrings that were exposed when the fixer added proper formatting. These files will need manual review:
- Files with incomplete docstrings (missing closing quotes)
- Files with malformed multi-line strings
- Files with syntax errors within docstring content

## Documentation
- Script documentation: `scripts/DOCSTRING_FIXER_README.md`
- Python syntax best practices: `docs/PYTHON_SYNTAX_BEST_PRACTICES.md`

## Next Steps
1. Review files that failed syntax validation
2. Fix any remaining syntax errors manually
3. Re-run pre-commit hooks to ensure all files pass validation
4. Consider adding the docstring fixer to the pre-commit configuration for automatic formatting

## Impact
This update improves code documentation consistency throughout the project, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase. Properly formatted docstrings also improve IDE support and documentation generation tools.
