## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Integration Flow
```
User Query → Sophia Orchestrator → Intent Detection → n8n Service → Workflow Execution
                                          ↓
                                    Workflow Templates
                                          ↓
                                    n8n REST API
```

### Service Components
1. **n8n Workflow Service** (`backend/services/n8n_workflow_service.py`)
   - Manages workflow lifecycle
   - Provides templates
   - Handles execution

2. **Orchestrator Integration** (`backend/services/sophia_unified_orchestrator.py`)
   - Detects workflow intents
   - Routes to n8n handler
   - Formats responses

3. **API Endpoints** (`backend/api/v4/workflows.py`)
   - REST API for workflow management
   - Direct workflow control
   - Metrics and monitoring

## 🛠️ Setup Requirements

### 1. n8n Instance
n8n must be running and accessible. Options:
- **Local**: `docker run -it --rm -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n`
- **Cloud**: Use n8n.cloud
- **Self-hosted**: Deploy on your infrastructure

### 2. Configuration
Add to your environment:
```bash
N8N_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5678
N8N_API_KEY=your-api-key
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5678/webhook
```

### 3. Permissions
Ensure n8n has access to:
- Modern Stack (for data queries)
- Slack (for notifications)
- GitHub (for code workflows)
- HubSpot/Gong (for business workflows)

## 📊 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Revenue Anomaly Detection
```javascript
// Workflow created from: "Alert me when revenue drops unexpectedly"
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "schedule",
      "parameters": { "interval": "hourly" }
    },
    {
      "type": "snowflake",
      "parameters": { 
        "query": "SELECT hour, revenue FROM metrics WHERE..."
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ai_analysis",
      "parameters": {
        "prompt": "Detect anomalies in: {{$json}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "conditional",
      "parameters": {
        "condition": "anomaly_detected == true"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "slack",
      "parameters": {
        "channel": "#alerts",
        "message": "Revenue anomaly: {{anomaly_details}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Customer Churn Prevention
```javascript
// Workflow created from: "Monitor for at-risk customers"
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "webhook",
      "parameters": { "path": "customer-event" }
    },
    {
      "type": "gong",
      "parameters": { 
        "operation": "getRecentCalls",
        "customerId": "{{$json.customer_id}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "hubspot",
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "getDealStatus",
        "customerId": "{{$json.customer_id}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ai_scoring",
      "parameters": {
        "model": "churn_prediction"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "linear",
      "parameters": {
        "createTask": true,
        "title": "Retention call needed: {{customer_name}}",
        "priority": "high"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Business Value

### Time Savings
- **Manual Report Generation**: 2 hours → 0 minutes (automated)
- **Customer Health Checks**: 30 min/customer → Real-time monitoring
- **Code Review Process**: 45 minutes → 5 minutes

### Quality Improvements
- **Consistency**: Same process every time
- **Speed**: Instant execution vs manual delays
- **Coverage**: Monitor 100% vs sampling

### ROI Examples
- **Daily Reports**: Save 10 hours/week = $50k/year
- **Customer Monitoring**: Prevent 2 churns/quarter = $200k saved
- **Code Quality**: Reduce bugs by 40% = $100k in prevented issues

## 🚨 Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. **n8n Required**: Must have n8n instance running
2. **API Limits**: Subject to n8n rate limits
3. **Complexity**: Very complex workflows may need manual editing

### Best Practices
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic workflows
2. **Test First**: Always test workflows before production
3. **Monitor Execution**: Check workflow logs regularly
4. **Version Control**: Export and version important workflows

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-drop interface in Sophia UI
2. **Workflow Analytics**: Performance metrics and optimization
3. **Template Library**: Expanded pre-built workflows
4. **Multi-tenant Support**: Workflow isolation per user/team

### Integration Roadmap
- **Temporal Integration**: Long-running workflows
- **Airflow Support**: Data pipeline orchestration
- **Zapier Compatibility**: Broader app ecosystem
- **Custom Nodes**: Sophia-specific workflow nodes

---

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Workflow service not available"
- Check n8n is running: `curl http://localhost:5678/healthz`
- Verify API key is set correctly
- Check network connectivity

#### "Failed to create workflow"
- Ensure n8n has required permissions
- Check workflow syntax in n8n UI
- Verify all referenced services are connected

#### "Workflow execution failed"
- Check workflow logs in n8n
- Verify credentials for integrated services
- Test each node individually
