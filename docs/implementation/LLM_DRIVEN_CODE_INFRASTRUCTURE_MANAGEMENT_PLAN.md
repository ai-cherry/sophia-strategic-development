# 🚀 LLM-Driven Code & Infrastructure Management via Unified Chat

## Executive Summary

This document outlines how Sophia AI's Unified Chat interface can be transformed into a powerful command center, enabling LLM and coding agents to interact with and manage the entire codebase, including infrastructure (Snowflake, Lambda) via IaC, and commit changes to GitHub.

## 🎯 Vision: Beyond Chat to Intelligent Development Partner

Transform the Unified Chat from a query interface into a conversational IDE and infrastructure management tool where users can:

- **Review Code:** "Sophia, review the employees_table definition for best practices"
- **Edit Code:** "Sophia, add a PHONE_NUMBER column to the EMPLOYEES table"
- **Write New Code:** "Sophia, create a function to summarize Gong customer interactions"
- **Commit to GitHub:** "Sophia, commit these changes to feature/add-phone-number branch"
- **Manage Infrastructure:** "Sophia, deploy the Snowflake schema changes to staging"
- **Troubleshoot:** "Sophia, diagnose why Notion sync is failing and fix it"

## 🏗️ Architecture: API-Driven Agent-Based System

### 1. Frontend Layer: Enhanced Unified Chat
```typescript
// Enhanced features for code/infrastructure management
interface CodeManagementFeatures {
  // Rich display components
  codeDiffViewer: CodeDiffComponent;
  syntaxHighlighter: SyntaxHighlightComponent;
  executionLogger: ExecutionLogComponent;

  // Interactive elements
  approvalButtons: ApprovalWorkflowComponent;
  suggestionEditor: CodeSuggestionComponent;
  deploymentMonitor: DeploymentStatusComponent;
}
```

### 2. Backend Layer: Intelligent Orchestration
```python
# Enhanced intent recognition for code/infrastructure commands
class CodeInfrastructureIntents(Enum):
    CODE_REVIEW = "code_review"
    CODE_EDIT = "code_edit"
    CODE_GENERATE = "code_generate"
    GITHUB_COMMIT = "github_commit"
    INFRA_DEPLOY = "infra_deploy"
    TROUBLESHOOT = "troubleshoot"
```

### 3. New MCP Servers: Specialized Coding Agents

#### 3.1 Code Management MCP Server
```python
# infrastructure/mcp_servers/code_management/server.py
class CodeManagementMCPServer:
    """
    Handles all code-related operations with secure sandboxing
    """

    async def review_code(self, file_path: str) -> CodeReview:
        # LLM-powered code review with best practices
        pass

    async def edit_code(self, file_path: str, changes: str) -> CodeDiff:
        # Generate and apply code changes
        pass

    async def generate_code(self, specification: str) -> GeneratedCode:
        # Create new code from natural language
        pass

    async def commit_to_github(self, changes: List[CodeChange]) -> PullRequest:
        # Create branch, commit, and open PR
        pass
```

#### 3.2 Infrastructure Management MCP Server
```python
# infrastructure/mcp_servers/infra_management/server.py
class InfrastructureManagementMCPServer:
    """
    Manages infrastructure via Pulumi and cloud APIs
    """

    async def preview_changes(self, stack: str) -> PulumiPreview:
        # Execute pulumi preview
        pass

    async def deploy_infrastructure(self, stack: str, approved: bool) -> DeploymentResult:
        # Execute pulumi up with approval
        pass

    async def manage_snowflake(self, operation: SnowflakeOp) -> SnowflakeResult:
        # Direct Snowflake DDL operations
        pass
```

## 🔐 Security & Sandboxing Architecture

### 1. Containerized Execution
```yaml
# Docker configuration for secure agent execution
services:
  code_management_agent:
    image: sophia-ai/code-agent:latest
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - DAC_OVERRIDE  # File operations only
    volumes:
      - ./sandbox:/workspace:rw
    networks:
      - agent_network
```

### 2. Approval Workflows
```python
class ApprovalWorkflow:
    """
    Mandatory human approval for critical operations
    """

    async def request_approval(self, operation: CriticalOperation) -> bool:
        # Send approval request to chat
        approval_request = {
            "type": "APPROVAL_REQUIRED",
            "operation": operation.description,
            "changes": operation.diff,
            "risk_level": operation.risk_assessment
        }

        # Wait for explicit user approval
        return await self.wait_for_user_approval(approval_request)
```

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Conversational Code Generation
```python
# Example interaction flow
user: "Create a function to analyze customer sentiment from Gong calls"

sophia: "I'll create a sentiment analysis function. Here's what I'm planning:
1. Connect to Gong API
2. Fetch recent calls
3. Extract transcripts
4. Run sentiment analysis
5. Store results in Snowflake

Here's the code:"

[Code diff display with syntax highlighting]

sophia: "This function will:
- Process up to 100 calls per batch
- Use Snowflake Cortex for sentiment analysis
- Cache results for 24 hours
- Handle errors gracefully

Would you like me to:
[Approve] [Modify] [Add Tests] [Cancel]"
```

### 2. Infrastructure as Conversation
```python
# Natural language infrastructure management
user: "Add a new staging environment for the MCP servers"

sophia: "I'll create a staging environment. Here's the plan:

Infrastructure changes:
- New Lambda Labs instance (16 vCPUs, 64GB RAM)
- Staging Docker Swarm cluster
- Separate Snowflake database
- Staging-specific secrets

Pulumi preview shows:
+ 15 resources to create
~ 3 resources to update

Estimated cost: $450/month

[Deploy] [Modify] [Cancel]"
```

### 3. Intelligent Troubleshooting
```python
# Automated debugging and fixing
user: "The Notion sync is failing, please investigate and fix"

sophia: "Investigating Notion sync failure...

Found issues:
1. ❌ API rate limit exceeded (429 errors)
2. ❌ Stale authentication token
3. ⚠️ Large payload causing timeouts

Proposed fixes:
1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Refresh auth token
3. Add pagination for large requests

I've prepared the fixes. Here's the diff:
