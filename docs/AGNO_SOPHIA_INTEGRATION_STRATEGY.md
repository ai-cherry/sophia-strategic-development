- Monitoring integration complete
- Documentation and training materials

## 📊 Performance Targets

### Agent Performance
- **Instantiation Time**: <10ms (vs existing ~100ms)
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB per agent (vs existing ~200MB)
- **Response Time**: <200ms for simple queries
- **Team Coordination**: <500ms for complex multi-agent analysis

### System Performance
- **Concurrent Agents**: Support 1000+ active agents
- **Request Throughput**: 10x improvement over current
- **Resource Efficiency**: 50% reduction in memory usage
