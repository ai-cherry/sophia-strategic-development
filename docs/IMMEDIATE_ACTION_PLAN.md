   # Test Cortex routing
   ```

## Success Criteria for 48 Hours

### Must Have ‚úÖ
- [ ] .cursorrules file in place
- [ ] Basic citation UI working
- [ ] Ice breaker prompts displayed
- [ ] Cortex model routing configured
- [ ] Memory service skeleton ready

### Nice to Have üéØ
- [ ] Follow-up suggestions working
- [ ] Citation hover previews
- [ ] Basic memory storage
- [ ] Cost tracking active

### Can Wait ‚è≥
- MCP integration
- Complex multi-agent coordination
- Advanced security features
- Production monitoring

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start development
cd /Users/lynnmusil/sophia-main

# Run frontend with citations
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Test backend routing
cd backend && pytest tests/test_cortex_router.py

# Check citation display
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
# Type a query and verify citations appear
```

## Validation Steps

1. **Citation Test**: Ask "What's our revenue?" and verify:
   - Response includes [1], [2] markers
   - Sidebar shows source details
   - Sources are relevant

2. **Ice Breaker Test**: Load chat and verify:
   - 4 suggested prompts appear
   - Clicking a prompt sends it
   - Prompts are business-relevant

3. **Routing Test**: Check logs to verify:
   - Simple queries use mistral-7b
   - Complex queries use larger models
   - Temperature varies by query type

## Next 48 Hours (Days 3-4)

- Implement Mem0 conversation storage
- Add focus mode selector
- Create template system
- Begin MCP planning

Remember: **Ship small, ship often**. It's better to have citations working perfectly than to attempt everything at once.
