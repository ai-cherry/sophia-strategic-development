# AI Coding Guidelines for Sophia AI

## Core Principle: Focus on Implementation, Not Timelines

### üö´ What NOT to Include in Coding Plans

When planning or discussing coding tasks, **NEVER** include:

- ‚ùå Specific time estimates (2 hours, 3 days, 1 week)
- ‚ùå Budget calculations for development effort
- ‚ùå Timeline-based milestones or deadlines
- ‚ùå Duration predictions for implementation
- ‚ùå Cost estimates for coding work
- ‚ùå Schedule-based planning

### ‚úÖ What TO Include in Coding Plans

When planning or discussing coding tasks, **ALWAYS** include:

- ‚úÖ **Technical Requirements**
  - Clear functional specifications
  - Technical dependencies
  - Integration points
  - Performance criteria

- ‚úÖ **Implementation Phases**
  - Phase 1: Foundation
  - Phase 2: Core Features
  - Phase 2.5: Enhancements
  - Phase 3: Advanced Features

- ‚úÖ **Complexity Indicators**
  - Simple: Single file, minimal dependencies
  - Moderate: Multiple files, some integration
  - Complex: Cross-system, multiple services
  - Critical: Core infrastructure, high risk

- ‚úÖ **Progress Tracking**
  - Feature complete checkmarks ‚úÖ
  - Functional milestones achieved
  - Technical blockers identified
  - Quality metrics met

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. **AI-Assisted Coding is Unpredictable**
- Each session is unique
- Discovery happens during implementation
- Requirements evolve as we code
- Quality matters more than speed

### 2. **Focus on What Matters**
- Technical correctness
- Code quality
- System stability
- Maintainability

### 3. **Avoid Wasteful Planning**
- Time spent estimating is time not coding
- Estimates are always wrong anyway
- Creates false expectations
- Distracts from technical excellence

## Practical Examples

### ‚ùå WRONG Way:
```
"Phase 1 will take 2 days and cost $500 in developer time"
"We can complete this feature in 8 hours"
"Week 1: Build foundation, Week 2: Add features"
```

### ‚úÖ RIGHT Way:
```
"Phase 1: Build foundation with intent classification"
"Next: Implement code modification service"
"Complex phase: Multi-model orchestration"
```

## Exception: Business Planning Context

Timeline and budget discussions are appropriate ONLY when:
- Explicitly requested for business planning
- Evaluating infrastructure costs (servers, services)
- ROI calculations for business decisions
- Strategic planning with stakeholders

Keep these completely separate from coding implementation discussions.

## Implementation Planning Template

When planning coding work, use this structure:

```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

### Technical Overview
- What it does
- How it integrates
- Key components

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Component A
- [ ] Component B
- [ ] Basic integration

#### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Feature X
- [ ] Feature Y
- [ ] Enhanced integration

#### Phase 3: Advanced
- [ ] Optimization
- [ ] Advanced features
- [ ] Polish

### Technical Dependencies
- Requires: Service A
- Integrates with: System B
- Uses: Library C

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- Performance < 200ms
- No security vulnerabilities
- Clean code standards met
```

## Remember

The goal is to build high-quality, maintainable code that solves real business problems. Time estimates don't help achieve this goal - they only create pressure and distraction.

Focus on:
- **Quality over Speed**
- **Correctness over Deadlines**
- **Understanding over Estimation**
- **Implementation over Planning**

This approach aligns with the CEO's priorities and the reality of AI-assisted development.
