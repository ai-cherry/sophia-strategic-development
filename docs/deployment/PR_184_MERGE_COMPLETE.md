# PR #184 Merge Complete: Lambda Labs Deployment Alignment

## 🎉 Successfully Merged

**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Commit**: `db17651fb`  
**Branch**: main

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **PR #184 Successfully Merged**
- All conflicts resolved cleanly
- Security issues fixed (removed exposed tokens)
- Successfully pushed to GitHub main branch

### 2. **Key Changes Applied**

#### Removed Conflicting Frontend Deployment
- ✅ Deleted `kubernetes/production/frontend-deployment.yaml`
- Eliminates confusion between Vercel and K8s deployment

#### Updated CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Modified `.github/workflows/deploy-k3s.yml`
- Now deploys ALL services: `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/production/`
- Previously only updated backend image

#### MCP Server Node Targeting
- ✅ Added `nodeSelector` to all 8 MCP deployment files:
  ```yaml
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: sophia-mcp-orchestrator
  ```
- All MCP servers will now deploy to 104.171.202.117

### 3. **Additional Files Created**

#### Node Labeling Script
- ✅ Created `scripts/label_mcp_node.sh`
- Labels the MCP node for proper pod scheduling
- Must be run before deploying MCP servers

#### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive deployment alignment reports
- Fixed security issues in documentation

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. **Label the MCP Node** (REQUIRED)
```bash
# SSH to a machine with kubectl access
./scripts/label_mcp_node.sh
```

### 2. **Deploy Updated Configuration**
```bash
# Apply all Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/production/
```

### 3. **Verify MCP Pod Placement**
```bash
# Check that MCP pods are on the correct node
kubectl get pods -n sophia-ai-prod -o wide | grep mcp
```

## 🎯 Deployment Alignment Status

### ✅ Resolved Issues
- MCP servers now properly targeted to dedicated node
- CI/CD pipeline deploys complete stack
- Frontend deployment confusion eliminated

### ⚠️ Remaining Considerations
- Frontend still on Vercel (strategic decision needed)
- "Serverless" terminology vs K3s reality
- Node labeling must be done manually

## 📊 Impact Summary

This merge significantly improves deployment alignment:
- **Before**: MCP servers scattered across nodes
- **After**: MCP servers consolidated on 104.171.202.117
- **Result**: Better resource isolation and management

The Lambda Labs deployment strategy is now much more aligned, with clear separation between:
- Backend API: 192.222.58.232
- MCP Servers: 104.171.202.117
- Frontend: Vercel (or future Lambda Labs migration)
