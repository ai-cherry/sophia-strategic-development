## üîß TO ACHIEVE FULL DEPLOYMENT

### Option 1: Deploy Backend to Cloud Service
```bash
# Deploy to Render.com
1. Create account at render.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Create new Web Service
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy from main branch
```

### Option 2: Use Lambda Labs (Existing Infrastructure)
```bash
# Deploy to Lambda Labs instance
1. Fix Docker build issues
2. Deploy using K3s/Kubernetes
3. Configure nginx reverse proxy
4. Point api.sophia-intel.ai to Lambda Labs IP
```

### Option 3: Quick Cloud Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Railway or Fly.io
1. Install Railway CLI: npm install -g @railway/cli
2. railway login
3. railway init
4. railway up
```

## üìù QUICK START COMMANDS

### Start Everything Locally:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
python backend/app/unified_chat_backend.py

# Terminal 2: Frontend development
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Redis (if not running)
redis-server
```

### Access Points:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8001
- API Docs: http://localhost:8001/docs
