### 2. ✅ Import Errors
- **Problem**: `OptimizedCache` vs `OptimizedHierarchicalCache` mismatch
- **Solution**: Automated import fixer script that corrects all occurrences

### 3. ✅ Manual Deployment Process
- **Problem**: Ad-hoc SSH commands and manual steps
- **Solution**: Fully automated GitHub Actions workflow with blue-green deployment

### 4. ✅ Cost Visibility
- **Problem**: $3,100+/month with unclear utilization
- **Solution**: Daily cost tracking, utilization monitoring, and optimization recommendations

### 5. ✅ Monitoring Gaps
- **Problem**: No proactive monitoring or alerting
- **Solution**: Prometheus/Grafana stack with automated health checks

## 📊 Infrastructure Status

- **GPU Utilization**: Increase from current <15% to target 70%+

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (0-24 hours)
```bash
# 1. Setup credentials
./scripts/lambda_labs/setup_credentials.sh

# 2. Fix import errors
python scripts/lambda_labs/fix_import_errors.py

# 3. Run health check
python scripts/lambda_labs/health_monitor.py

# 4. Deploy via GitHub Actions
git push origin main
```

### Phase 2: Monitoring Setup (24-48 hours)
```bash
# Deploy monitoring stack
for ip in 192.222.58.232 104.171.202.117; do
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/sophia2025 ubuntu@$ip 'docker run -d --name node-exporter ...'
done

# Configure Grafana dashboards
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/monitoring/dashboards/
```

### Phase 3: Cost Optimization (48-72 hours)
```bash
# Run cost analysis
python scripts/lambda_labs/cost_optimizer.py

# Deploy auto-scaling
./auto_scaling.sh &

# Configure business hours scheduling
crontab -e  # Add shutdown/startup schedule
```
