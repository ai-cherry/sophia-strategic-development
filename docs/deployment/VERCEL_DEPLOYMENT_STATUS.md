- **Cache**: Redis

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

If you're experiencing issues with the Vercel deployment:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - The production deployment should work without special tricks
   - If seeing old content, clear cache and refresh

2. **Check Backend Connection**
   - The frontend may show limited functionality if backend isn't deployed
   - Current backend is running locally

3. **API Configuration**
   - Frontend expects backend at: https://api.sophia-intel.ai
   - Currently you need local backend running

## 🚀 WHAT'S WORKING

### ✅ On Vercel Production
- React application loads
- UI components render
- Dark theme applied
- Routing configured

### ⚠️ Needs Backend Deployment
- Chat functionality (requires backend API)
- Modern Stack data queries
- MCP server orchestration
- Real-time updates

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy Backend to Lambda Labs**
   ```bash
   # Backend needs to be deployed to api.sophia-intel.ai
   # Currently running locally on port 8001
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Modern Stack credentials
   - API keys
   - WebSocket URLs

3. **Test End-to-End**
   - Verify chat works
   - Check data connections
   - Monitor performance

## 🎉 SUCCESS!
