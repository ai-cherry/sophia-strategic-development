# PR #184 Merge Summary: Lambda Labs Deployment Alignment

## Overview
Successfully merged PR #184 on July 11, 2025, which addresses critical deployment misalignments with Lambda Labs infrastructure.

## Changes Applied

### 1. **Frontend Deployment Clarification**
- ✅ **Removed** `kubernetes/production/frontend-deployment.yaml`
- This eliminates confusion between Vercel and Kubernetes deployment strategies
- Frontend remains on Vercel as per current architecture

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**
- ✅ **Updated** `.github/workflows/deploy-k3s.yml`
- Changed from only updating backend image to deploying ALL services
- Now runs `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/production/` instead of just `kubectl set image`

### 3. **MCP Server Node Targeting**
- ✅ **Added nodeSelector** to all 8 MCP deployment files:
  ```yaml
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: sophia-mcp-orchestrator
  ```
- Affected files:
  - `mcp-ai-memory-deployment.yaml`
  - `mcp-asana-deployment.yaml`
  - `mcp-codacy-deployment.yaml`
  - `mcp-github-deployment.yaml`
  - `mcp-gong-deployment.yaml`
  - `mcp-linear-deployment.yaml`
  - `mcp-slack-deployment.yaml`
  - `mcp-ELIMINATED-deployment.yaml`

## Current Deployment Alignment Status

### ✅ Improvements Made
1. **MCP Server Targeting**: All MCP servers now configured to deploy to 104.171.202.117
2. **CI/CD Completeness**: Pipeline now deploys all services, not just backend updates
3. **Frontend Clarity**: Removed conflicting Kubernetes frontend deployment

### ⚠️ Remaining Misalignments
1. **Frontend Platform**: Still on Vercel, not Lambda Labs
2. **"Serverless" Terminology**: Backend uses K3s containers, not true serverless functions
3. **Node Labeling Required**: Must run `scripts/label_mcp_node.sh` to label the MCP node

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Label the MCP Node**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/label_mcp_node.sh
   ```
   This will label the node at 104.171.202.117 as `sophia-mcp-orchestrator`

2. **Deploy Updated Configuration**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/production/
   ```

3. **Verify MCP Pod Placement**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n sophia-ai-prod -o wide | grep mcp
   ```
   Ensure all MCP pods are scheduled on the 104.171.202.117 node

### Future Considerations
1. **Frontend Migration**: If truly want all components on Lambda Labs, need to:
   - Remove Vercel configuration
   - Setup Nginx on Lambda Labs frontend server
   - Update all documentation

2. **True Serverless**: If serverless functions are required:
   - Consider Lambda Labs Inference API for AI workloads
   - Or accept current K3s container architecture

## Summary
PR #184 successfully addresses 2 of the 3 major deployment misalignments:
- ✅ MCP servers now target correct node (104.171.202.117)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline deploys all services
- ⚠️ Frontend remains on Vercel (requires strategic decision)

The deployment is now significantly more aligned with the stated Lambda Labs strategy, with clear paths forward for remaining items.
