## üéØ Recommendations

### For Immediate Testing:
```bash
python scripts/deploy_backend_instant.py
```
- Gets you running in 30 seconds
- Perfect for "just make it work"

### For Production (No GPU):
```bash
python scripts/deploy_backend_free.py
# Choose Railway (1) or Fly.io (3)
```
- Free, reliable, permanent URL
- Good enough for most use cases

### For Production (With AI/GPU):
```bash
python scripts/deploy_to_lambda_quick.py
```
- When you need serious compute
- For Snowflake Cortex AI operations
- Worth the $1.10/hour

## üîß After Deployment

1. **Update Vercel Frontend:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add: `VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url`
   - Redeploy

2. **Test the Connection:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-backend-url/health
   ```

3. **Check API Docs:**
   - Visit: `https://your-backend-url/docs`

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with ngrok** for immediate testing
2. **Move to Railway/Fly.io** for production
3. **Use Lambda Labs** only if you need GPU/heavy compute
4. **Don't overthink it** - you can always migrate later

The backend is already optimized to run on any of these platforms!
