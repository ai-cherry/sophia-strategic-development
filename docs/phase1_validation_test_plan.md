# Sophia AI Enhancement Plan - Phase 1 Validation Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines the comprehensive validation strategy for all Phase 1 enhancements implemented in the Sophia AI platform. The plan covers testing for hierarchical cache system, audit logging, role-based access control (RBAC), ephemeral credentials system, and MCP network/I/O optimizations.

## Test Environment

- **Development Environment**: Local development sandbox with isolated database
- **Staging Environment**: Production-like environment with representative data volumes
- **Production Environment**: Limited A/B testing with controlled user groups

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

Individual component testing to verify correct implementation of specific functions and classes.

### 2. Integration Tests

Testing interactions between components to ensure they work together correctly.

### 3. System Tests

End-to-end testing of complete workflows to validate overall system behavior.

### 4. Performance Tests

Measuring system performance metrics to ensure enhancements meet performance targets.

### 5. Security Tests

Validating security controls and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
