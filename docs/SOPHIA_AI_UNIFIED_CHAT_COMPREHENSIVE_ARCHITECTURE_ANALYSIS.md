        "is_ui_request": any(term in message_lower for term in [
            "design", "ui", "ux", "component", "interface", "mockup",
            "prototype", "figma", "create ui", "generate design"
        ]),
        "is_knowledge_query": any(term in message_lower for term in [
            "what is", "how does", "explain", "tell me about", "define",
            "documentation", "knowledge", "information"
        ]),
        "is_project_query": any(term in message_lower for term in [
            "project", "task", "asana", "linear", "status", "progress",
            "deadline", "milestone", "okr"
        ]),
        "requires_search": any(term in message_lower for term in [
            "search", "find", "look up", "latest", "recent", "news"
        ])
    }
```
