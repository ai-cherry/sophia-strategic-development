  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'requirements.txt'
      - 'pyproject.toml'

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Security vulnerability scan
        run: |
          pip install safety bandit
          safety check --json
          bandit -r . -f json

      - name: Auto-merge critical security PRs
        if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'security')
        run: |
          # Auto-merge PRs with "Critical" severity
          # After automated testing passes
```

#### 3. **Real-time Security Monitoring**
```python
# scripts/security-monitor.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Real-time security monitoring and alerting system
"""
import requests
import json
import time
from datetime import datetime

class SecurityMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.github_token = os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN')
        self.repo = 'ai-cherry/sophia-main'

    def check_vulnerabilities(self):
        """Check for new security vulnerabilities"""
        url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{self.repo}/vulnerability-alerts"
        headers = {'Authorization': f'token {self.github_token}'}

        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            alerts = response.json()
            critical_alerts = [a for a in alerts if a['severity'] == 'critical']

            if critical_alerts:
                self.send_alert(critical_alerts)

    def send_alert(self, alerts):
        """Send immediate alert for critical vulnerabilities"""
        # Implementation for Slack/email alerts
        pass

    def auto_create_security_pr(self, vulnerability):
        """Automatically create PR for security fixes"""
        # Implementation for automated PR creation
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor = SecurityMonitor()
    monitor.check_vulnerabilities()
```
