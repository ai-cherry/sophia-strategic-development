## 🎬 **DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Verification** ⏱️ 5 minutes
```bash
# 1. Verify GitHub secrets
# 2. Test Lambda Labs connectivity
# 3. Validate MCP server files
```

### **Phase 2: Production Deployment** ⏱️ 15 minutes
```bash
# Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
# Manual: GitHub → Actions → "Deploy MCP Servers to Production" → Run workflow
# Automatic: Triggered on mcp-servers/ changes
```

### **Phase 3: Health Verification** ⏱️ 5 minutes
```bash
# Automated health checks for deployed servers
curl http://165.1.69.44:3008/health  # Codacy MCP
curl http://165.1.69.44:9004/health  # Linear MCP
```

### **Phase 4: Business Integration** ⏱️ 10 minutes
```bash
# Update Cursor MCP configuration to use production endpoints
# Test end-to-end AI coding assistance workflow
# Validate real-time project monitoring
```
