## 🎯 Critical Issues Resolved

### **1. ai_memory Port Conflict - FIXED ✅**

**Problem:** ai_memory assigned 9000 in strategy, 9001 in Kubernetes/monitoring  
**Solution:** Updated all configurations to use strategic port 9000  
**Result:** ai_memory now consistently using port 9000 across all systems  

**Files Fixed:**
- `k8s/mcp-servers/ai-memory.yaml` (containerPort: 9001 → 9000)
- `scripts/monitor_mcp_servers.py` (port: 9001 → 9000)

### **2. Configuration Chaos - RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem:** Multiple conflicting configuration files with different port assignments  
**Solution:** Created single source of truth: `config/mcp_master_port_registry.json`  
**Result:** All port assignments now reference master registry  

**Master Registry Features:**
- Strategic tier organization (Core AI, Business Intelligence, Development, Infrastructure)
- Health check ports (+100 offset pattern)
- GPU requirements and replica specifications
- Environment separation support (production, staging, development, testing)

### **3. Port Conflicts Across Services - ELIMINATED ✅**

**Problem:** Services scattered across wrong tiers with conflicting assignments  
**Solution:** Implemented strategic tier-based port allocation  
**Result:** All services properly organized by tier with unique ports  

**Strategic Port Assignments (Before → After):**
- ai_memory: 9001 → **9000** ✅
- hubspot: 9003 → **9020** ✅  
- gong: 9004 → **9021** ✅
- slack: 9005 → **9022** ✅
- linear: 9006 → **9023** ✅
- asana: 9007 → **9024** ✅
- github: 9007 → **9040** ✅
- notion: Various → **9025** ✅

### **4. Missing Infrastructure Services - MAPPED ✅**

**Problem:** Core strategic services not deployed (mcp_orchestrator, portkey_gateway, etc.)  
**Solution:** Mapped existing services to strategic roles, identified deployment gaps  
**Result:** Strategic service mapping complete, deployment roadmap established  

**Service Mapping Achievements:**
- sophia-vector_search_mcp → qdrant_admin (port 9002)
- sophia-real_time_chat_mcp → unified_chat (port 9004)
- sophia-postgres_mcp → postgres_manager (port 9007)
