   - Updated CI/CD workflows for K3s deployment
   - Fixed deployment documentation

2. **Security Remediation**
   - Fixed PostgreSQL password reuse vulnerability
   - Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities in services and MCP server
   - Removed legacy scripts with hardcoded credentials:
     - `start_sophia_absolute_fix.py`
     - `start_production_mcp.sh`
     - `scripts/deploy_sophia_production_clean.py`
